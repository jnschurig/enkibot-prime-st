## Class Tips
* Here are some general tips for your jobs!
* [KGT] The Knight is straightforward, but the combo of !Guard + Cover is amazing.
* [KGT] If the party is in critical HP, you ignore all single-target physical attacks.
* [KGT] This is especially brutal with a way to inflict Berserk. White Mages can do so easily with a spell, but all staff and rod users can later on.
* [KGT] Chemists can also Berserk, though if you have Chemist you don't need !Guard to win.
* [KGT] Bear in mind that even if you have Two-Handed equipped, you CAN equip a Shield mid-combat through the item menu.
* [KGT] This will take away your Two-Handed damage bonus until you unequip the shield, but can be useful with elemental absorption shields.
* [MNK] Monks do amazing damage at first, but rapidly taper off after World 1.
* [MNK] Barehanded attacks can get critical hits, allowing you to penetrate high physical defense.
* [MNK] 'HP +X%' abilities can allow your squishier classes to survive the final boss's Almagest.
* [MNK] Most parties will just use their Monk as a beefy item user or spellcaster later in the game.
* [THF] Thieves have access to some very good items earlier than usual. This guide will note particuarly juicy steals.
* [THF] Unfortunately, bad stats and garbage gear options probably make Thief the worst of the Wind jobs overall.
* [THF] The capstone Thief ability, Artful Dodger, grants +16 Agility, which is actually a lot.
* [THF] Lastly, remember that the Thief's !Mug ability is a safe way to use the Chicken Knife, even if it's 'just' a normal attack.
* [BLM] Black Mage is great. Just blow up everything in the game with your obscene damage output.
* [BLM] Remember that equipped Rods increase the power of matching elemental spells by 50%. Your currently equipped weapon can be changed mid-battle from the Item Menu.
* [BLM] If your whole party is Reflected, you can bounce a groupcast spell off them for double damage.
* [WHM] White Mage is pretty broken.
* [WHM] Protect, Shell, and Blink let you to go toe-to-toe with almost anything.
* [WHM] Many bosses are vulnerable to the Confuse, Silence, and Berserk status ailments.
* [WHM] Casting Mini on the party raises their evasion into the stratosphere, especially if they have a shield, and doesn't affect magical damage output.
* [WHM] Once you have it, Holy is a fantastic single target damage option, easily on par with other powerful classes.
* [BLU] Blue Mage is completely broken.
* [BLU] Dark Spark + L5 Death lets you two-shot about half the bosses in the game.
* [BLU] White Wind is the best healing spell in the game, and even works on Bone Mail wearers.
* [BLU] L2 Old isn't as impressive as L5 Death, but trivializes several otherwise difficult fights. Also, the two are a combo together. Death by math!
* [BLU] Mighty Guard is basically farewell to being worried about straight damage, forever.
* [BLU] With the wind-boosting Air Knife, the Aero/ra/ga line of spells is solid damage.
* [BLU] Vampire is bugged to do damage equal to your missing HP and heal that much on GBA, but only half that on SNES and mobile.
* [BER] All jokes aside, the first Berserker is a surprisingly solid class. It's when you're stuck with multiples that the trouble starts.
* [BER] They hit super hard, get plate armor, axe attacks divide the target's physical defense by 4, and they can also equip daggers if axe/hammer accuracy is a concern.
* [BER] Special shoutout to the Death Sickle you can farm in World 1. It can cast Death when it hits, and even a lot of bosses die to that proc.
* [BER] Berserkers with any magic command equipped are brutal with a Rune Axe.
* [BER] On the SNES version only, a Berserker (3 magic) with a Thornlet (-5 magic) underflows to 253 magic. The Gaia Hammer, which casts Quake when attacking, deals stupid amounts of damage with that.
* [BER] If you've got a 3+ Berserker run, you should definitely play on SNES, even if Sandworm is significantly harder.
* [BER] If you have 4 Berserkers, I'm sorry (or you picked the secret command.)  Play on SNES, grind to 18+ for Liquid Flame and 40+ for Sandworm, Thief's Knife some extra Thornlets for your extra Gaia Hammers. And good luck.
* [MYS] Mystic Knight is completely broken.
* [MYS] Status effect spellblades have a 100% chance to land for all non-immune enemies.
* [MYS] Several bosses have very high magic evade, making normal status ailment applications very unlikely. You completely ignore that.
* [MYS] Elemental -aga Spellblades instantly kill anything with a weakness to it, or 'just' do 4x damage and ignore defense to Heavy targets with a weakness (like many bosses.)
* [MYS] Use Drain or status swords in random encounters. Elemental swords do nothing against enemies neutral to that element.
* [MYS] If you need to quickly disenchant a sword, just un/re-equip it from the item menu mid-combat.
* [TIM] Time Mages may not be able to heal, but they can use the Healing Staff from Tycoon.
* [TIM] They can also break rods if they need magic damage before they get Comet.
* [TIM] The Slow spell is available early and works on nearly everything.
* [TIM] Comet and Meteor do damage independent of your stats/gear (other than level) and bypass Reflect.
* [SUM] Summoner is pretty broken.
* [SUM] They have incredible damage output, but generally only have one 'good' element at a time.
* [SUM] Remember that you can always snap an elemental rod for higher-power fire/lightning/ice damage.
* [SUM] Don't bother deliberately skipping optional summons to boost !Call. It's still trash even if you only get Ifrit, Titan, and Syldra.
* [SUM] Air Knife boosted Syldras are your best offensive option through the endgame. Which means that the side quests to get Bahamut and Leviathan are pointless.
* [SUM] Don't underestimate Golem - he can singlehandedly neuter physical-heavy bosses.
* [SUM] ...or anyone you can land Berserk on, which Summoners can (once per fight) with the Wonder Wand.
* [RDM] Sorry, Red Mage kind of blows, unless you have another mage and the patience to grind ABP for !Dualcast.
* [RDM] By itself, Red Mage's only good offense is rod snapping. Stock up.
* [RDM] Yes, they can equip swords. Yes, also they have absolutely no strength and even less survivability.
* [RDM] More importantly, they can equip staves, granting early access to Cura (Healing Staff) and any access at all to Berserk (Power Staff) and Dispel (Judgment Staff).
* [RDM] There's a surprising amount of utility in low-level White Magic, especially with !Dualcast. Two Protect or Raise casts in only one action is powerful.
* [RDM] You can also stick Confuse/Silence/Sleep onto enemies much more reliably with two attempts per turn.
* [RDM] Even with that, if the rest of your party is strong, grinding out !Dualcast likely takes too long to bother.
* [BST] Beastmaster is completely broken, but it takes significant amounts of effort.
* [BST] !Releasing the correct monster can trivialize any boss fight.
* [BST] Each individual boss entry here has a suggested !Release noted. For more details, check http://tinyurl.com/catchspreadsheet
* [BST] Remember that Beastmasters aren't the worst physically, and Whips can attack from the back row.
* [GEO] !Gaia is tricky to work with, but can pull out powerful effects sometimes.
* [GEO] Many of the stronger !Gaia effects are Wind-based, so Air Knives make Geomancer much better.
* [GEO] Bells are weird. Don't be fooled by their attack stat - 2 of the 4 Bells run off of Magic and Agility, while the other 2 have Strength-based Rune-Axe-like formulas.
* [NIN] Ninja's Dual Wield passive is as good as in any game, especially on other classes.
* [NIN] Having the Twin Lance in the main hand bypasses the Chicken Knife's !Flee proc on SNES and GBA.
* [NIN] But the secret power ability is often !Throw. Scrolls have a higher base power than level 3 magic!
* [NIN] Giving a Ninja a magic ability like !Summon or !White to boost their magic stat makes scrolls completely obscene.
* [NIN] Having an elemental rod equipped also boosts the elemental scrolls by 50%, just like regular spells.
* [NIN] You can bury everything in the game, including the final boss, in a hail of anime wallscrolls.
* [BRD] Bard is secretly one of the best classes in the game.
* [BRD] Equip Harps transfers great agility and magic stats, which is nice for things like Rune Axe Berserkers and !Throwing Ninjas.
* [BRD] Romeo's Ballad and Alluring Air are fantastically effective against random encounters.
* [BRD] Stat-boosting songs, especially Swift Song, allow you to steamroll any boss you can stay alive against.
* [BRD] Even the final boss melts against a level 99 party with 99 strength, magic, and speed.
* [RAN] Ranger is pretty broken, but not until you pony up 605 AP.
* [RAN] The Ranger's signature ability is !Rapid Fire, which hits 4 times for half damage.
* [RAN] ...it also never misses, procs !Spellblade, ignores defense (!) and doesn't proc the Chicken Knife (!!).
* [RAN] This rarely comes up in a Fiesta run, but savor the combination of Rapid Fire+Spellblade on a Freelancer if you get it.
* [RAN] If you're between level 10 and 19, !Animals often gives Nightingale, a powerful partywide heal effect. Useful in late World 1.
* [SAM] The Samurai is basically a big beefcake with a few dirty tricks available at need.
* [SAM] Katanas can get critical hits, which ignore physical defense.
* [SAM] !Zeninage is expensive, since it literally tosses gil, but it's amazing all-target damage on low-defense enemies.
* [SAM] !Iainuki is an 85% chance of instant death to all enemies. A surprising number of bosses are not Heavy, and therefore vulnerable to this.
* [DRG] The Dragoon is a vanilla beefcake with almost no dirty tricks available.
* [DRG] !Lance is a last-resort method for mages to restore their own MP mid-fight. It's straight up unusable running off a Dragoon's innate magic score.
* [DRG] Remember that !Jump does full damage when used from the back row, and double damage with spears.
* [DRG] Careful timing and knowledge of boss patterns can allows you to dodge nasty attacks.
* [DNC] Dancers are an extremely squishy front-row class heavily dependent on luck. But when !Dance rolls Sword Dance, they murder things.
* [DNC] Certain pieces of gear (Rainbow Dress. Ignore Lamia's Tiara once you have a Dress, and ignore Red Slippers always.) boost the rate of Sword Dances, amping Dancer's lategame offense.
* [DNC] Sword Dance is also a safe way to wield the Chicken Knife.
* [DNC] The real benefit of Dancer is the ability to learn Equip Ribbon. Being able to ignore almost all status effects is often worth 'losing' your ability slot.
* [DNC+MNK] Barehanded is compatible with Sword Dance, and it can crit just like any other fist attack.
* [CHM] Chemist can carry any party. It's obscene. It makes Blue Mage look bad.
* [CHM] !Drink allows them to haste themselves and double their HP, making survivability easy.
* [CHM] But the real power of the class lies in !Mix.
* [CHM] Their staple damage option is Succubus Kiss (Turtle Shell + Maiden's Kiss), which is a 255 magic power version of Drain.
* [CHM] That's stronger than Meteor, Holy, and Flare, available halfway through World 1, and heals the user to boot.
* [CHM] Various easy !Mixes can also cast Haste, Protect, Shell, heal to full, revive with full health, and refill MP.
* [CHM] !Mix can also give elemental/status immunities and inflict aliments with 100% accuracy.
* [FRE] Despite its lack of abilities, the equipment options available to a Freelancer make it more powerful than a fair number of 'normal' classes.
* [FRE] By endgame, a Freelancer can attack or use a weapon to inflict Blind, Paralyze, Old, Sleep, Berserk, Poison, Confuse, and Death.
* [FRE] ...and also cast Firaga, Blizzaga, Thundaga, Bio, Dispel, Raise, Protect, Return, and Haste. For free.
* [FRE] That's not even getting into their ability to wear a Ribbon, the Aegis Shield, and the Bone Mail simultaneously.
* [FRE] They also gain the best stats from the other jobs in your party once those jobs are mastered, along with two ability slots instead of one.
* [MIM] A special class obtained only in World 3 in Sunken Walse Tower.
* [MIM] They have !Mimic instead of !Fight, and three free slots for abilities in addition to that (which includes !Fight and !Item).
* [MIM] Their equipment access is middling, though they do keep the best stats and innate passives of mastered classes, just like Freelancer.
* [MIM] !Mimic is an interesting ability, though timing it to do what you want can be tricky with cast times being different.
* [MIM] !Mimicing !Zeninage still consumes money, but everything else, including items and spells, are used at no cost.
* [MIM] You also still get random effects from things like !Dance or !Animals - you're copying the command, not the result.
* [MIM] !Mimicing a rod snap (or other weapon use from the Items menu) uses the weapon in the Mime's hand as an item. This won't make a rod snap unless the Mime already has a rod equipped.
* [GLD] A forbidden class you can normally only get in GBA and Matrix after getting all four tablets.
* [GLD] Strong, beefy, and can use almost any physical weapon, plus shields.
* [GLD] !Bladeblitz physically attacks all enemies at 75% power. Good for random encounters and the occasional boss (like Necrophobe's Barriers).
* [GLD] !Finisher can either do nothing, inflict a critical hit, or deal 9999 damage of the crystal element of the character using it.
* [GLD] That's Wind for Bartz, Water for Lenna, Earth for Galuf and Krile, and Fire for Faris.
* [GLD] !Finisher's odds of doing stronger hits goes up with the job mastery level, peaking at 50% 9999, 25% critical hit, 25% miss.
* [GLD] Long Reach is a passive that lets you deal full damage attacking from the back row with any weapon. Rarely worth the !Finisher (or something from another job) slot.
* [GLD] Lure is a passive that increases encounter rate. Pretty useless, unless you really need to grind.
* [ORC] A forbidden class you can normally only get in GBA and Matrix after getting all four tablets.
* [ORC] Has a higher magic stat than even Summoner, but can only use Staves, and its !Predict ability is... difficult to use at best.
* [ORC] !Condemn works on any target that's not Heavy, totally ignoring status immunity. Just Doom anything it works on, or Rejuvenate yourself.
* [ORC] Its wait time goes down as your Oracle job level increases.
* [ORC] !Predict has effects determined by the last digit of the user's MP, at a power determined by the last digit of its target's HP.
* [ORC] Several !Predicts can hit your own party. This can be beneficial or deadly depending on your equipment.
* [ORC] Cleansing, which triggers at last digit of MP=0, only hits enemies and does non-elemental damage. It's reliable.
* [ORC] Blessing, which triggers at last digit of MP=7, only hits the party and heals and Regens. It's also reliable.
* [ORC] Second Rank Cleansing (3 MP) and Third Rank Blessing (7 MP) combo into each other infinitely if you don't want to think about it.
* [ORC] Also note that !Predict bypasses enemy React scripts, so they never counter. This includes Omega. Be careful not to kill Tree Exdeath this way, you'll skip NED.
* [ORC] Read Ahead is a passive that lowers the encounter rate. It's a solid time-saver that's totally useless for bosses. Kind of like Oracle.
* [CAN] A forbidden class you can normally only get in GBA and Matrix after getting all four tablets.
* [CAN] Average stats and equipment access (notably, you do get the Aegis Shield), but amazing abilities.
* [CAN] !Open Fire is ridiculous early on, doing good damage and also randomly inflicting one of Poison/Blind/Confuse/Death. Fiesta Mod Cannoneers have it super easy.
* [CAN] !Combine can only be used once you've actually unlocked Cannoneer, as the materials used for it are only sold in special shops that don't appear until then.
* [CAN] Blitzshot+Dark Matter makes Chaos Cannon, which inflicts Death.
* [CAN] Blitzshot+Iron Draft makes Vulner Cannon, which halves physical and magical defense and also doesn't trigger counterattacks. Eat it, Omega.
* [CAN] Blitzshot+Gold Needle makes Needle Cannon, which deals a flat 3000 damage. Useful for very high-defense targets.
* [CAN] You can also set Berserk (with Power Drink), Blind (with Ash), Old (with Speed Shake), Slow (with Turtle Shell), and even Poison (with Blastshot+Dark Matter).

## Version Differences
* There are some fairly significant differences in bugs and functionality between the four versions of FFV.
* Those versions are 1) SNES [and PS1, and the Project Demi hack] 2) GBA 3) 'Matrix' [the developer of the port, formerly available on iOS, Android, and Steam] and 4) Pixel [console, iOS, Android, and Steam].
* Note that Matrix is not for sale anywhere anymore, which can be a shame for a few specific team comps. In general, you probably want to use something else anyway.
* These tips show the applicable ones for your four jobs!
* Pixel seriously buffs rod snapping by removing the multi-target penalty from it, making snapping rods stronger than most summon magic.
* In addition, you can snap unequipped rods in the Item menu, allowing you to benefit from the elemental boost of having a rod on when you do snap it! Only a boosted Leviathan would be more powerful.
* [KGT] On Pixel, the Brave Blade formula has been changed to slowly regenerate power over time. So you can flee once in a while. Huge buff.
* [BLM] Due to unspecified formula changes, all-target magic spells deal more damage on Matrix. This makes farming (especially statues) slightly easier. Uncertain about Pixel.
* [BLM] As a trade-off, you can no longer all-target Thundaga on your own party and reflect 3/4 of it onto Omega to bypass its counterattacks. If this is your Omega plan, play SNES or GBA.
* [WHM] On SNES, Bridge Gilgamesh can be Silenced with Silence. This is a very small change, and you have Protect anyway, so don't let it be the tiebreaker over your personal preference.
* [THF] On Matrix, Liquid Flame is in the back row, halving all attack damage. If you only have Thieves before the Fire Crystal, this is atrocious for you.
* [THF] On Matrix and Pixel, you can run even faster with a Thief, stacking with the existing sprint button. Gotta go fast.
* [THF] On Pixel, you can't run away from the Ramuh fight, denying you an easy source of infinite W1 Hi-Potions. This will actually matter if you have no other good job before the Earth Crystal.
* [MNK] On Matrix, !Kick works at full power from the back row. It is also no longer boosted by Kaiser Knuckles, but you weren't wearing those anyway.
* [BLU] Vampire is bugged on GBA to deal/restore your entire missing health, rather than half. Big improvement!
* [BLU] On Pixel, being immune to Old doesn't prevent Time Slip from inflicting Sleep. Better against Atomos, for one.
* [TIM] The Matrix and Pixel versions fix 'quickleaking', the glitch where breaking a Venom Rod as your first action on Quick will cause it to tick until you take your second action, so you lose your free Triple Crown.
* [TIM] On SNES, Meteor can hit dummy targets. This makes the final boss harder, because there are two. You want to be on GBA if Time Mage is your best offense for NED.
* [RDM] On SNES, Bridge Gilgamesh can be Silenced with Silence. This is a very small change, and you do have Protect, so likely don't let it be the tiebreaker over your personal preference.
* [BER] On SNES, Berserkers can attack dummy targets. This makes 1-2 Berserker runs significantly worse against Sandworm, Necrophobe, and NED.
* [BER] On Matrix, Berserkers always attack the default target from selecting 'Attack', typically the first one in the front row. This is really bad for NED because it pushes each piece into enrage mode one by one.
* [BER] On Matrix and Pixel, Berserkers act independently and don't start battles with empty ATB. This is good.
* [BER] Basically, GBA/Pixel is down to preference if you only have 1-2 Berserkers. Pixel makes them a little better, but they're still Berserkers, so let your other classes decide.
* [BER] Once you have 3+ Berserkers, the best damage output will be on SNES - utilizing the Thornlet magic underflow glitch makes your Gaia Hammer Berserker an all-star.
* [GEO] !Gaia results are level-independent on Matrix, but not any of the three versions you can actually buy.
* [MYS] On Pixel, Sleep Spellblade wakes up an already-sleeping target. This makes fights where you want to use it more difficult but also doesn't really matter that much.
* [BST] !Calm is only bugged on GBA, so you lose your free Triple Crown if you use other versions.
* [RAN] !Rapid Fire can attack dummy targets on SNES. This makes runs with Ranger significantly better against Necrophobe and NED (and technically Sandworm (do not !Rapid Fire the Sandworm)) in every other version.
* [RAN] !Animals results are level-independent on Matrix, but not any of the three versions you can actually buy.
* [BRD] Songs raise numbers to a maximum of 255 on Matrix/Pixel, versus 99 on SNES/GBA. This doesn't matter in practice, but you can make even more hilariously large numbers.
* [BRD] Tree-form Exdeath's physical attacks don't break !Sing on SNES or GBA, but do on Matrix and Pixel, which makes the final fight slightly safer on Pixel.
* [BRD] Hero's Rime blocks other non-Rime level changes on Pixel. This is worse if you also have Chemist, but better against Dischord/Old.
* [BRD] On the SNES and GBA versions, there's an interesting glitch where if you 1) have a Bard sing a stat boosting song, then 2) put them to Sleep with a spell and 3) wake them up, the song they're singing will continue ticking upwards despite them being free to act.
* [BRD] If they sing another stat song, the first song will go away, so you want to do other actions like dealing damage or singing songs like Romeo's Ballad. Or !Hide. Yes, they keep singing while hidden.
* [BRD] This is easiest with a Black or Red Mage buddy that can cast the spell Sleep. Theoretically a reflected Sleep proc from the Sleep Blade would work but... that's unlikely at best.
* [BRD] !Hide doesn't run enemies out of MP on Pixel. They get refunds for anything cast with no targets. Mostly relevant against W2 Exdeath and Omniscient, if at all.
* [BRD+BLU] Time Slip can trigger the singing glitch but it will Old your Bard, so take that into consideration. Also make sure they aren't immune to Old or Time Slip will fail entirely!
* [BRD+RAN] !Rapid Fire doesn't work with harps on Pixel. This probably doesn't matter, but it was one of the best Shinryu offense options...
* [NIN] If you don't have a better Chicken Knife user, Dual Wielding a Twin Lance in the mainhand will disable the !Flee proc on SNES and GBA, but not Matrix/Pixel.
* [NIN] If you do have a better Chicken Knife user, the Dancing Dagger's Sword Dance proc triggers a Dance from both weapons, not just one, on Matrix/Pixel.
* [CHM] The Death Potion !Mix is blockable on Matrix, so Chemists are better on SNES or GBA.
* [CHM] Some(?) !Mixes are newly blockable on Pixel. Death Potion is still not. Succubus Kiss is also unblockable AND doesn't provoke counters to boot, so you can murder Omega and Omniscient with even more ease than before.
* [SAM] !Mineuchi is correctly coded on Matrix and Pixel: only half power, but actually will Paralyze. It DOES bypass Chicken Knife procs on Pixel, but DOES NOT on SNES/GBA/Matrix.
* [SAM] You're trading off damage (on an ability you'll never use) for the ability to paralyze random encounters, Titan, Carbuncle, the Gargoyles, Melusine, Catastrophe, and the Vacuum Wave part of NED.
* [SAM] Those bosses are all heavy (or optional), so the Paralyze will be almost useless, but it is a point to consider, I guess.
* [DNC] Sword Dance does full damage from back row in Pixel. Enjoy being more defensive for free!
* [DNC] For some reason, !Dance doesn't trigger Omniscient's counters on Pixel. What.
* [MIM] Pixel added a later-FF style button to switch between party members with full ATB bars. Which is good if you want to !Mimic something in particular.
* [CAN|ORC|GLD] If you have an Advance job, play GBA. Duh.

## Post-Wind Shrine
* Most classes will not need to purchase gear in Tule to beat Karlabos, but it's cheap.
* [BST] If you plan on releasing it against the Antlion, don't open the Goblin-trapped chest in the Training House.
* [BRD] Play the piano in the Pub for your Bard.
* [BLU] You can revisit the pirate cave now and learn Vampire from the bats there.
* [BLU] Also, you should definitely get Aero from the Moldwynds in the Wind Shrine and probably also Goblin Punch from the Black Goblins.
* [BLU] The next boss is level 5 if you want to specifically match levels for the 8x Goblin Punch damage bonus.
* [WHM] To save yourself some gil, don't forget the hidden Staff in the lower-right corner of Floor 4 of the Wind Shrine.

## Karlabos
* The Something Awful Forums -> Let's Play -> Let's All Solo FFV And Get Murdered By Karl Boss
* 650 HP, weak to Lightning, can inflict paralysis or lower a character to 1 HP. Basically the worst for solo games.
* Just Potion up after getting hit by Tail Screw and you'll be fine.
* [KGT|MNK] You'd kind of have to be trying to lose with Monk or Knight.
* [KGT|MNK] Large HP total plus strong physical attacks turns this fight into 'attack a lot and use a Potion after every Tail Screw.'
* [BLU] Blue Mages should make sure they learn Vampire and Goblin Punch first from Steel Bats and, well, Goblins.
* [BLU] Karlabos is level 5, so a level 5 Blue Mage will deal about 240 damage with Goblin Punch.
* [BLM] Black Mages can spam Thunder to hit a convenient elemental weakness. It's almost like Karlabos is a tutorial boss!
* [WHM] Take the fight slow and heal, you'll get him eventually. If you're stuck you can get another point of M at level 8.
* [THF] Thief gets more points of M at levels 5 and 11. You may need to grind it out, or spend an inordinate amount of potions.
* [THF] Faris's starting Dagger is your strongest weapon, and two of your party members will have no weapon. Plan accordingly.

## Ship Graveyard
* If you're feeling low on healing, the Carcruthls and Undead Husks in here both rarely drop Elixirs. Best grind spot is on the shipwreck after the Save Point, where the World Map was. It guarantees at least one Husk per encounter.
* Don't forget, if you need to grind for any reason, you can sleep both below decks on Faris's ship and by the save point.
* [WHM] The enemies here are Undead, which makes this a great place to gain levels with your White Mages. Just Cure them to death.
* [WHM] Make sure you pick up the hidden Flail, as White Mage parties will rely on it for damage for a while. It's south of where you start.
* [THF] The Daggers dropped by Skeletons here are the only way to outfit your entire Thief party; get a full set of four before fighting Siren.
* [KGT] Because they sometimes factor AGI in, the Daggers dropped by Skeletons here can be better than Broadswords. Not worth the time, though.
* [NIN] If you expect to have trouble against Byblos much later, you can farm Fire Scrolls off the Mindflushers here.

## Siren
* 900 HP; switches between a high-magic-defense human form and a high-physical-defense fire-weak undead form.
* Siren is Heavy, so no getting cheeky with Phoenix Down on the undead form.
* [WHM] You can use Cure to deal big damage to the undead form.
* [WHM] The Flail ignores defense, which means you can actually also do some pretty nice damage to the human form.
* [WHM] Remember that the Flail can be used from the back row at 100% damage.
* [BLM] The undead form is weak to Fire.
* [BLU] Don't try to use Vampire on the Undead form. The results are as predictable as they are unfortunate.
* [MNK] Fist criticals can penetrate Siren's hefty physical defense even in undead form.

## Carwen/North Mountain
* The hidden Frost Rod in Carwen lets you trivialize either Magissa or Garula, so get it.
* [WHM] Pick up Protect in the Carwen magic shop. You'll use it in basically every boss fight.
* [BRD] The second piano is in the Carwen pub.
* [KGT] Optionally, get heavy armor from the armor shop in Carwen for a nice defense upgrade.
* [KGT] More importantly, definitely buy Long Swords. They're much better than Daggers and Broadswords.
* [THF] You can steal Gold Needles from the Cockatrices on North Mountain, which is a nice way to save some gil.
* [BLU] If you restore their MP with Ether first, you can learn Flash from Headstones in North Mountain.
* [BLU] You can learn it normally in the Fire-Powered Ship, so it only matters for two boss fights, but it's nice.

## Magissa + Forza
* Magissa has 650 HP and alternates between black magic and [Drain or Fight]. On her first turn after reaching 300 HP, she summons Forza.
* Forza has 850 HP and can easily one-shot a squishy character in the front row.
* [WHM] It's possible to sandbag your way through Magissa's 200 MP before she summons Forza.
* [WHM] Or you can just Silence her, refresh it periodically, and not care about her MP. And also cast Protect on everyone before Forza arrives.
* [THF] Just bring a lot of potions if you have 4 Thieves. There's no real way to finesse this fight.
* [THF] If you're really in trouble, grind to level 16. With 4 Daggers, you can bring Magissa from 320 to dead (and skip Forza) in one set of four !Fights.
* [BLM|BLU] You can snap the Frost Rod from Carwen here. Pushing Magissa from >300 to dead skips Forza altogether.
* [BLU] If you're not going to abuse rod snapping, your Blue Mage can blind Forza with Flash.
* [BLM] If you're not going to abuse rod snapping, you can also just Sleep Forza and unload on Magissa.
* [BLM] Spells won't wake Forza up so he'll fall easily enough as well.

## Walse/Walse Tower
* At Walse Town you can pick up a free Silver Specs in a pot in the house you need to go into the water to reach. It'll make you immune to Blind, which is better than nothing in that slot!
* [SUM] The waterfall behind Walse Castle has the Shiva fight, which is critical for Summoners.
* [SUM] ...but you won't have Summoner until after the next dungeon, so Shiva can wait. Come back with Flame Rods from Ricard Mages.
* [KGT] You can buy Iron Armor in Walse, though it's not strictly necessary since you can still cheese Garula easily with your Knight.
* [THF] Please, please, please steal four Mythril Daggers from the Wyverns in Walse Tower.
* [THF] Also, buy or steal at least 60 Potions. Sorry, Garula just sucks as Thief.
* [BLU] In the waterfall behind Walse Castle, you can learn Pond's Chorus from an Elf Toad left standing alone on the battlefield.
* [BLU] Not only does it softlock Garula, it's a nice spell to have in general.
* [THF] Thieves have a fairly easy time getting the Elven Mantle in the basement of Walse Castle with !Flee. It's nice for your slog against Garula.
* The Ricard Mages in Walse Tower can drop Flame Rods, if you snapped the free Frost Rod on Magissa and want another Rod for Garula.

## Tycoon (optional)
* Check a world map to see how you can get back to Tycoon Castle early with the wind drake.
* The treasures are mostly healing items, including two Elixirs and three Cottages.
* Two of those Cottages are hidden - walk into the castle courtyard, but before going in head over to the right wall and walk through a passage behind a tower.
* You'll also get a Healing Staff, which casts Cura on its attack target instead of attacking for damage.
* [SAM|FRE] You'll also get an Ashura, which is the first katana. It can critical hit and it's got good attack for this early.
* [FRE] Freelancers also get good mileage out of the Diamond Bell, it's Back Row OK and feeds off your pretty good Magic stat.
* [SUM] This is also a good time to head to the tower behind the waterfall in Walse to get Shiva.
* [SUM] For a free kill, break two Flame Rods dropped in Walse Tower or bought slightly later in Karnak.
* [GEO] For all that we make jokes about GEO, the Diamond Bell's realy good this early. It's Back Row OK and feeds off your pretty good Magic stat.

## Garula
* 1200 HP, begins countering every attack with Rush at 800 HP.
* Weak to Paralysis, like from the Whip, if you currently have someone to wield it.
* A definite trainwreck waiting to happen for unlucky and unprepared players.
* Of course, you can also farm up a Flame Rod from a Ricard Mage downstairs, or use the Frost Rod from Carwen.
* [KGT] Knights can cheese this fight with three critical-HP characters and one Knight using nothing but !Guard.
* [KGT] Rush still inflicts Sap, so bring a few potions.
* [KGT] If you already have Two-Handed, it means half as many counterattacks before you kill. Good idea.
* [WHM] White Mages can cast Protect to make Garula's offense half as dangerous.
* [WHM] For 4x White Mage parties, put everyone in the back row and ONLY attack with the Flail to minimize counterattacks.
* [WHM] It's easy enough to grind out, especially with the Healing Staff. Also incredibly boring.
* [THF] 4x Thief parties should have a Mythril Knife attacker in the front row and 3 Potion chuckers in the back row.
* [THF] Seriously, expect to burn through 50-60+ Potions if you're at a reasonable level.
* [THF] As a corollary, check when you get your next knife M increase on both Faris and Bartz, and maybe grind to it if it's close.
* [MNK] The Monk's !Focus, which lets you hit twice as hard half as often, helps immensely with the counterattack mechanic.
* [BLU] Garula is weak to Frog, so you can cast Pond's Chorus, have it spend its turn curing Frog, and repeat.
* [BLU] Blind will also work, if for some reason Frog abuse isn't enough.
* [FRE] Garula is vulnerable to Paralyze, so the Whip can lock it down and prevent counterattacks. It doesn't always proc, but it goes a long way.

## Karnak/Fire-Powered Ship
* You'll only get one discounted item at a Karnak store, so pick a pricey one.  Mythril Hammer is the most expensive item in the store.
* In the Matrix version, you can buy up to 99 of the discounted item at once, then resell them all to double your cash.
* Wild Nakks outside of Karnak are the easiest way to farm cash in world 1.
* This is especially nice since the Karnak weapon shop is the only source of Rods in world 1.
* Stock up before setting foot in the Fire-Powered Ship. Rods make the Karnak 500 so much easier.
* [CHM] Now's the perfect time to farm Turtle Shells from Grass Tortoises. They are pretty common in the grasslands just outside the meteorite you arrived through.
* [CHM] You probably want most of a full stack of 99. You can farm them again in W2 or W3, but you're here now and they only get more obnoxious to find.
* [CHM] Succubus Kiss is going to be your main !Mix offense for most boss fights for the rest of the game. Also they're used for some other stuff like Turtle Soup.
* [BRD] The third piano is in Karnak's Pub, so make sure to play that for your Bard.
* [BLM] The magic store here sells Poison and Sleep.
* [WHM] The magic store here sells Cura, Raise, and Confuse.
* [TIM] The magic store here sells Stop and Gravity.
* After some plot business, you'll be sent off to the next dungeon, the Fire-Powered Ship.
* [BLU] Wild Nakks can teach your Blue Mage the ???? spell, which is Vampire without the drain, so it is basically useless except for costing 0 MP.
* [BLU] Crew Dusts in the Fire Ship cast Flash, if you didn't get it from Headstones earlier.
* [THF|NIN] Make sure to get the Moonring Blade. It does full damage from the back row and is an attack power upgrade.
* [THF] Don't skip the chest with the Thief's Gloves, which boost !Steal's success rate from 40% to 80%.
* [THF] Once you have them, you can steal Hi-Potions from Poltergeists to your heart's content.
* [THF] You can also steal Ethers from Motor Traps, which show up after you kill a Defeater when it's alone.
* [FRE] If you have plans to steal literally anything later, don't skip the chest with the Thief's Gloves, which boosts the success rate of the Thief Knife's ~Mug proc from 40% to 80%.
* [FRE] Yes, this is going to be ages from now, but you'd look really silly having to beat Fork Tower to come back.
* [FRE] You want to steal things if you have any other Aegis Shield user beyond your Freelancer, for example.

## Liquid Flame
* 3000 HP, transitions randomly between three forms when hit. All three forms absorb wind and fire.
* The Human Form has single and multi target attacks and counters hits with Blaze.
* The Hand Form has single target attacks that can paralyze and counters hits with Fira. It runs out of MP after three casts. Absorbs fire, nullifies ALL other elements including ice.
* The Tornado Form casts Fira on itself to heal. It runs out of MP after five casts. It drops a Fire Bow to save you buying one in Crescent.
* [RAN|FRE] Killing Liquid Flame in Tornado Form makes it drop a Fire Bow, helpful in the next dungon and not buyable until later.
* [WHM|RDM] Liquid Flame can be confused, leading it to do nothing except attack itself. Doesn't stop form changes, but gives you lots of time to heal.
* [WHM] Honestly, this is probably the best way for you to kill it. It doesn't form change on hitting itself, it doesn't heal up...
* Frost Rods will kill in two snaps. Don't use them when it's in hand form!
* [TIM] Casting Gravity works on the human and tornado forms.
* [TIM] One cast of Gravity followed up by a Frost Rod snap (again, only on the human and tornado forms) should kill.
* [MNK] Fewer, bigger hits are better against counter-heavy enemies, so !Focus is good here.
* [KGT] Fewer, bigger hits are better against counter-heavy enemies, so Two-Handed is good here.
* [MYS] Blizzara Sword will inflict massive damage. Make sure you have a way to damage Hand Form to turn it back to a Form weak to ice.
* [MYS] You can unequip your weapon and re-equip it through the Item menu to remove your !Spellblade effect without using your turn, if you don't have a better way.
* Since the forms' MP are tracked separately and Tornado Form doesn't attack you, consider just sitting there until it runs out of MP.
* [BER] Consider going into the fight with your Berserker dead to control phase changes, at least until you run Tornado out of MP so it can't heal.
* [BLU] All three forms absorb wind, so don't use Aero. Just break rods.

## The Karnak 500
* You have ten minutes to get as much loot out of the Karnak 500 as possible. (Karnak 1000 just doesn't roll off the tongue as easily)
* Take the opportunity immediately after you kill Liquid Flame to set your jobs and abilities. The Karnak timer keeps ticking even in the menu.
* It's best to look up a map if this is your first time. There's a decent one on GameFAQs at https://www.gamefaqs.com/ps/562810-final-fantasy-v/faqs/49618?raw=1
* If you're having trouble with the Sergeant + Cur Nakk encounter, kill the Sergeant to make the dogs run away.
* [WHM|RDM] You can also Confuse the Sergeant, which prevents the script that tells the Curs to attack.
* [KGT] RUN RUN RUN. No, the Brave Blade isn't worth it. Never take the Brave Blade.
* [KGT] You demolish chest enemies with Two-Handed attacks, if you have it.
* [THF] If your offense is good, you can steal plenty of Elixirs from the Gigas enemies in every trapped chest.
* [THF] Remember, you can !Flee from trapped chests and re-open them again to steal again! This is your best use of any remaining time after you've beaten Iron Claw but before you leave the area.
* [THF] You should also common-steal some Mage Mashers from the Sorcerers in chests here.
* Get the Elven Mantle and Main Gauche; those are the best unconditional loot in here.
* [DNC|FRE] There's also a Ribbon! Get the Ribbon! And never take it off.
* [BLU] You can learn Aera from the Gigases here for your Blue Mage, though it won't be too long until you can get it again.
* [BLU] Since the Gigases are immune to wind themselves, parties relying on !Blue will have serious damage problems here.
* [BLU] Consider running straight to the exit to learn Death Claw, then doubling back to clear out the trapped chests.
* [BLM|RDM] You have the firepower (literally) to grab every chest with time to spare, if you want them.
* [BLM|RDM] I like to farm up gil for a few rods off Wild Nakks before coming here, to extra-trivialize things.
* [WHM] White Mages should definitely not forget about the Esuna spell in a chest here; it'll be a while until you can buy it.
* You'll have to kill Iron Claw, a miniboss with 900 HP and some Cur Nakk friends, before you exit the castle.
* [BLU] He can teach you Death Claw, and this is the only spot to get it for a while. It's lovely against anything that's not Heavy.
* [BLU] Don't kill the Sergeant before he transforms into Iron Claw if you want Death Claw.

## Library
* On the walk down, dodge the desert unless you want to fight the powerful Dhorme Chimera.
* You can heal for free in the Library by drinking from the pot on the left side of the second floor.
* Inside the library, remember that Page 64 can and will use Level 5 Death on any party members with a level divisible by 5.
* Don't be fooled by the one 'mandatory' fight with a book. You can still run from that.
* [BLU] Blue Mages obviously have to grind to 15 or 20 to learn Level 5 Death for yourself, but make sure your whole party is not at that level.
* [BLU] You can also learn Moon Flute in here from Page 256, but all it does is Berserk your party. Yes, even when you cast it rather than the enemy.
* [BLU] Page 32 casts Aera, if you missed it from Gigas in the Karnak 500.
* [BLU] You could learn Aqua Breath from the Dhorme Chimera in the desert outside, but you'll have some time to level for more HP before you need it for the Sandworm. Your call.
* [THF] Page 256 has a stealable Ninja Suit, a pretty respectable piece of cloth armor.
* [THF] That said, you'll be able to just buy them not too long from now.
* [GEO] Geomancers will often get fire-elemental Ignus Fatuus from !Gaia here, so they're actually good.
* [BLU+BST] !Control will also let you learn (the marginally useful) Off-Guard from the Page 256.
* [BLU+BST] The same for (the useless) Transfusion from Mythril Dragons in the forest outside.

## Ifrit
* 3000 HP, alternates between (Fira or Flame) and (Fight or Flame)
* 20% physical evasion, which can be annoying.
* Snapping a couple of Frost Rods will work with with minimal fuss.
* [BLM|RDM|SUM] So will simply blasting away with Ice-elemental attacks, if you're low on money.
* [MYS] Mystic Knights can set Silence with a !Spellblade before going to town with Blizzara Sword.
* [BLU] Aqua Rake is actually nonelemental damge, so it won't be super-effective here.
* [BLU] Ifrit is vulnerable to Blind, which will help lower incoming damage slightly.
* [WHM] Ifrit is vulnerable to Silence and Confuse, though the latter mostly means self-targeted Firas for lots of healing.
* [WHM] Worst case scenario, you can do a full MP stall-out this way.
* [TIM] Ifrit is vulnerable to Slow.
* [GEO] Ignus Fatuus deals fire damage, so don't use !Gaia here.
* [THF] The Mage Masher(s) you stole from the Karnak 500 can proc Silence on Ifrit.
* [BST] Beastmasters can !Release one or more Zu from the grassland outside Karnak for a solid 750 damage each.
* [BST] Even better, a Bandersnatch from near Walse (or just left of Torna Canal) has a 50/50 chance of inflicting instant death. Bit of a walk, though.
* [BST] Ifrit is also vulnerable to Paralyze from the Whip, although 20% physical evasion makes it not a total lock.

## Byblos
* 3600 HP, uses a variety of debilitating spells which make prolonged engagements almost unwinnable.
* Also features 'fun' Drain counterattacks and self-Protect.
* That combination can make this fight brutal for parties with only physical damage.
* Happily, you can just snap a couple of Flame Rods and call it a day.
* [BLM|RDM] Or you can just cast Fira a few times if money is tight.
* [KGT] Knights should rely on Two-Handed in this fight and any other fight where counterattacks are an issue.
* [NIN] I hope you got the Flame Scroll drop from Liquid Flame if you don't have a better strategy for doing this.
* [NIN] You could also have farmed them in the Ship Graveyard all the way back.
* [NIN] If you're willing to retrace that many steps, they drop from Mindflushers in the room where the World Map was.
* [BER] Berserker-heavy teams can have trouble here, because they can trigger Byblos' counters at bad times.
* [BER] If you have other powerful characters or a way to cheese the fight, consider coming in with your Berserker(s) dead.
* [SUM] Summon Ifrit for some extra comedy and large damage.
* [MYS] Byblos is weak to fire, so Fira !Spellblade is great.
* [GEO] Geomancers rejoice! !Gaia here gets you Ignus Fatuus, which is Fire damage. For once, it's worthwhile.
* [TIM] Time Mages with an aversion to rod abuse can still land Slow, making the fight much easier.
* [TIM] Byblos isn't heavy, so Gravity also works if you want to spare a rod by spoiling a child.
* [BLU] Byblos isn't heavy or immune to paralysis, so Death Claw works to end this fight immediately.
* [BLU] On the other hand, you might want to learn Magic Hammer here, which can be obnoxious as hell.
* [BLU] There's at least one fight (Bridgegamesh) that's reasonable to use Magic Hammer in before you get another chance to learn it, so it's your call.
* [BST|FRE] The Whip Magissa dropped all that time ago will paralyze-lock Byblos.
* [BST] A released Page 32 will cast Banish for a 33% chance of killing Byblos.

## Sailing
* There's a few useful things you can do with the Fire-Powered Ship before you progress the plot.
* After the Karnak 500, a new merchant appears walking around in the Karnak weapon/armor shop. He sells a bunch of stuff for jobs you may not have yet.
* The random trash encounters around Jachol are difficult, since you're not 'supposed' to be there yet.
* The stores in Jachol sell Mage Mashers, Coral Swords, katanas, bows, and the Ninja Suit.
* [BRD] Bards can play the fourth Piano in Jachol, also. You don't have to do this right now, but do it before you leave W1.
* [GEO] The cave near Jachol has Skull Eater encounters that give 5 ABP and drop Elixirs.
* [GEO] They hit hard and fast, but !Gaia either oneshots them with Stalactite or (possibly) confuses them with Ignus Fatuus.
* [GEO] For Geomancers, this is a great grind spot for ABP and Elixirs.
* [BLM|RDM] Black and Red Mages can pick up the Toad spell in Istory. Walk in a circle on the flowers in the top-left of the town.
* [SUM] Summoners can learn Ramuh from an encounter outside Istory.
* [THF] Ramuh's common steal is a Hi-Potion and he's a 70% encounter outside Istory until you use the Ramuh item dropped from the fight.
* [THF] If you're not on Pixel, you can steal Hi-Potions forever if you keep running from the fight. On Pixel, you can't run away from this fight. Sorry.
* [BRD] Bards can learn Romeo's Ballad in Istory, which Stops all enemies.
* [BRD] In addition to being situationally useful against bosses, it's an incredible trash-clearing tool for the rest of the game.
* [BRD] They can also play the fifth piano in Crescent, and talk to the composer NPC to learn Mighty March, which you will never use.
* Rod-having parties can also pull the legendary 'Dragondarch Manuever' outside Istory, farming the tough Mini Dragons there for XP with Thunder Rods.
* You likely don't want to bother. Not only are raw levels not that great, it's kind of slow.
* [NIN] Despite not having rods, Ninjas can also farm the Mini Dragons outside of Istory for XP with Thunder Scrolls.
* [BER|FRE] Swing by Crescent Island and farm up some Death Sickles from the Harvesters there.
* [SUM|NIN|BLM|RDM|BLU] Parties with reliable AoE magic, like !Summon or thrown scrolls, can farm the small island north of Crescent for XP and ABP.
* [SUM|NIN|BLM|RDM|BLU] The only encounter there is 5 Black Flames, which have high evade but get oneshot by AoE magic.
* [BLU] Blue Mages can learn Dark Spark from those same Black Flames.
* [BLU] It halves the target's level, which combines with L5 Death and L2 Old to murder a bunch of bosses.
* [BLU] You can also pick up the almost-useless Self-Destruct from Bombs near Jachol.
* [BLU] It is useful (and also funny) for one particular boss fight much later, so you should probably get it.
* [BST] The cave near Jachol has a Blitz Whip in a treasure chest near the end. A nice weapon upgrade for now.
* [BST] If you're interested, !Control will let you farm Prototypes (they Self-Destruct) on an island west of Crescent.
* [BST] It's pretty good XP/ABP.
* [CHM+BST] ...especially since you have a Chemist, who can use the guaranteed Dark Matter drops for several bosses later.

## Chocobo Forest
* Comedy note, if you land the black chocobo in its home forest, the game tries to make you catch it again...
* ...but you can just leave the forest and it'll respawn right under you.
* Pop by Lix in the north to buy half-price items, most importantly Ethers.
* [CHM] Chemists should definitely empty their wallet for Ethers here. You'll miss them dearly when you leave W1.
* [NIN] The weapon shop sells !Throw-able elemental scrolls for 200 gil each. Stock up.
* [BRD] Bartz's old house has an NPC that teaches Alluring Air, which inflicts Confuse on all enemies.
* [BRD] What few random encounters don't get punked by Romeo's Ballad are often trivialized by this.

## Sandworm (Zerkersbane)
* 3000 HP, can use Fight or Quicksand (~50 party damage and HP Sap).
* Attacking the wrong hole triggers a Gravity counterattack.
* The game tells you not to use magic here. The game is lying. Use magic if at all possible.
* Breaking rods does lots of damage, so despite provoking two Gravity counters per rod break it's still the way to go.
* [BER] Berserkers will repeatedly wipe your party here by being stupid. Kill or blind yours before coming into the fight.
* [BER] If you have 4 berserkers, my condolences. Level 35 is the recommended minimum, 38 is easier, 40 should be more than enough.
* [BER] If you're on the Matrix version, Berserkers will always attack the front target. This balances out to be just as stupid.
* [NIN] !Thrown Scrolls will work just fine on the Sandworm. Water is no more effective than Flame or Thunder, so use whichever.
* [BLU] The Dhorme Chimera in the desert south of Karnak can teach you Aqua Breath, which will nearly one-shot the Sandworm.
* [BST] The Dhorme Chimera in the desert south of Karnak casts Aqua Breath on !Release, which will nearly one-shot the Sandworm.
* [TIM] Sandworm is vulnerable to Slow. You can do that first or just skip straight to breaking rods, your choice.

## The Desert of Shifting Sands
* [NIN] Water Scrolls (bought in Lix) murder everything in the desert, even though they didn't do that to Sandworm. Water element is weird.
* [THF+DRG] You should steal a Javelin from the Sand Bears here.
* [THF+DRG] The Javelin is literally the fourth-best spear in the game, and won't be replaced until the very end of World 2.
* [THF+FRE] You should probably steal a Javelin from the Sand Bears here.
* [THF+FRE] The Javelin is literally the fourth-best spear in the game, and your Freelancer will appreciate it.
* [BST] Get used to coming back here to !Capture more Sand Bears before every hard boss fight for the rest of W1.
* [BST] When !Released, they hit for ~2200 physical damage, which is kind of a lot in W1.
* To get the treasure chests in the Catapult, answer no when you interact with the switch, THEN yes. (Pull, not push.)
* This tip is false for the Pixel remake, where you actually have to try to push the switch, then go through the rigamarole. Sorry.
* [WHM|RDM] Make sure you don't miss the !White spell Mini in one of them. You can buy it later, but it's a LOT later.

## Crayclaw
* 2000 HP, uses various single-target attacks.
* Signature combo is inflicting Sap, then using Tail Screw to reduce the target to single-digit HP.
* High physical and magical defenses, but weak to many statuses. Remember that elemental weaknesses (here, lightning) ignore magic defense.
* Yes, this is another fight you can end with two rods.
* You can also use any other source of lightning damage.
* [BST] ...or just Bearaga.
* [BST] Crayclaw is also vulnerable to Paralyze, so the Whip can lock it down.
* [BST] Outside of the GBA version, there is no !Calm bug, so you can also lock Crayclaw down with !Calm (because it's a Magic Beast.)
* [MYS|BLM|RDM] Crayclaw is also vulnerable to Sleep, if you'd like to before you get your Thundara on.
* [KGT|BLU] There are lightning-elemental Coral Swords in Jachol's weapon shop, if you're willing to make the detour.
* [NIN] Thunder Scrolls murder Crayclaw, and if you don't have spares a common random encounter (Thunder Anemone) on the ocean drops them.
* [TIM] Crayclaw is vulnerable to Stop and Slow, so you can lock it down while you snap rods.
* [RAN|FRE] The Thunder Bow from Crescent Town's weapon shop hits Crayclaw's elemental weakness.
* [BRD] Crayclaw is vulnerable to Confuse, so Alluring Air will lock it down.
* Critical hits and axes work if you have no other way through.

## Adamantoise
* The Adamantoise has 2000 HP, good magic evade, and sky-high physical defenses.
* It has powerful physical attacks, which you'll want to scam with back-row + mitigation/status aliments.
* The hard part is simply managing to get damage past its defenses.
* Any source of Ice damage hits its elemental weakness, bypassing its defenses.
* This includes breaking Frost Rods.
* [RAN] You can use the Frost Bow from Crescent's weapon shop.
* [KGT] A boss that only uses single-target physical attacks. You have !Cover. Have fun.
* [BLU] Don't bother with rods. Adamantoise is level 20, so just cast Level 5 Death.
* [BST] It's not immune to death, so !Releasing a Bandersnatch (from the land next to the the Torna Canal) to cast Blaster has a 50/50 chance of killing it.
* [BER|FRE] No death immunity, so Death Sickles will eventually get there.
* [MNK] Fist criticals break through physical defense. It might take a while, but it works.
* [WHM] Protect everyone and leave them in the back row, since Adamantoise only physically attacks.
* The Something Awful Forums >> Ask/Tell > [ASK] Me About Doing Adamantoise With Only Bards (aka 'Kyrosiris's Least Favorite Boss')

## Soul Cannon
* [BLU] The turrets you fight before Soul Cannon can teach you Missile and Flamethrower.
* [BLU] The latter is exactly as powerful as Fira, so it's a very solid damage option with a Flame Rod equipped.
* 12500 HP, weak to lightning, charges up and then casts Wave Cannon, and casts get faster after the first.
* Wave Cannon deals 50% of the party's max HP and inflicts HP Leak.
* The real danger is the Launchers. Each of them has 800 effective HP and can inflict Old. And they're in the back row on Pixel, for some reason.
* Try to kill the Launchers quickly to avoid having your whole party delevelled and slowed into uselessness.
* [BLU] You can Level 5 Death the Launchers.
* It'll take two rods (of any flavor, since they have no weakness) to kill the Launchers, unless you've been grinding.
* [SUM] Or just cast boosted Ramuh, dealing good damage to the Cannon as well.
* [NIN] Thunder scrolls work especially well on Soul Cannon itself.
* [WHM] Parties with !White can get through this slowly by using Esuna to cure Old and healing after Wave Cannons.
* [WHM] Note that Esuna doesn't undo the level loss caused by Old! Cure the status effect ASAP to minimize the damage.
* [KGT] Coral Swords hit Soul Cannon's Lightning weakness.
* [GEO] All you'll get in this fight is Wind Slash! Awesome! ...except Soul Cannon and the Launchers are immune to wind.
* [GEO] Yes, Geomancers are completely useless here aside from knife/bell attacks.
* [GEO] The best Elixir grind spot is in the Ship Graveyard, inside the shipwreck after the Save Point, where the World Map was. You'll need them.
* [TIM] Stop from a Time Mage will work on the Launchers, if for some reason you're allergic to rod abuse.
* [TIM] Soul Cannon itself is vulnerable to Slow.
* [BRD] This is a funny fight for Bards, since they can Romeo's Ballad lock the Launchers and Hide from the Wave Cannons.
* [BRD] That said, the best Elixir grind spot is in the Ship Graveyard, inside the shipwreck after the Save Point, where the World Map was. You still might need them."
* [BST] You may be able to rush the Soul Cannon down with four Bearagas (~9k damage) plus some attacks.
* [BST] If you have a way to damage it, you could !Capture a Prototype and release it for ~1k all-target damage to deal with the Launchers in one shot, but that's a big if there.
* All damage in this fight is percentage-based, so armor does nothing. Consider unequipping it to lower your Equip Weight to 7 or below to act slightly faster.

## Ronka Ruins
* Don't hit the speed trap!
* [CHM] This is your last opportunity with all 4 party members to farm Prototypes on the island west of Crescent for Dark Matter.
* [CHM] You will want a total of 6 if you are Death Potioning every vulnerable boss before the next source of them (the Pyramid in W3) and you already have 1 from Soul Cannon.
* [CHM] Prototype is vulnerable to Berserk, but you can't set Blind as well without Dragon Fangs. Mostly just kiss it to death.
* [KGT|RDM|KGT|GLD|FRE] The Ancient Sword in a chest here is a way to inflict Old, which can come in handy for some bosses.
* [DNC+THF] Dancer + Thief parties should steal a Lamia's Tiara from Lamias here, which boosts Sword Dance's proc rate.
* [DNC+THF] You won't wear it forever, because Ribbons and Rainbow Dresses both exist, but it has its uses for pure DPS races in the meantime.
* [DNC+THF] Lamia's Tiara is SIGNIFICANTLY more useful on Pixel, because it also boosts !Flirt success from 50% to 100%, and !Flirt now works on everything.
* [DNC+THF] You still will replace it with a Rainbow Dress later, but it's more useful in the meantime!
* [BLU] If you missed it in Karnak, the Enchanted Fan can teach you Aera.
* [BST+BLU] A !Controlled Enchanted Fan can also teach you White Wind, which is KIND OF A BIG DEAL.
* [BST+BLU] You can also learn 1000 Needles from !Controlled Lamias, which is pretty handy for a few fights coming up.
* [BLU+WHM] You can Confuse an Enchanted Fan to learn White Wind, which you really should since it's rad.
* [BLU+RDM] You can Confuse an Enchanted Fan to learn White Wind, which you really should since it's rad.
* [BLU+BRD] You can Confuse an Enchanted Fan to learn White Wind, which you really should since it's rad.
* [BLU] Frankly it's a pain in the ass for a useless spell. but you can hunt down the Ghidra to learn L4 Graviga at this point too.
* [BLU] On GBA, you can quicksave to get the rare Ghidra encounter easily. Doesn't make the spell any more useful, though.
* [THF] Enjoy the brief moment of Find Passages being relevant. It won't happen again for a while.
* [THF+RAN] Ghidra have a Killer Bow as a rare steal, which you can't otherwise get until W2. Not mandatory, but good for Manticore if nothing else.

## Archaeoavis
* Has 5 forms, each with their own HP pool but all with a single shared MP pool.
* The forms have steadily decreasing physical defense and steadily increasing magic defense.
* Form 1 has 1600 HP, is weak to wind, has the highest physical defense, and inflicts Sap.
* Form 2 has 1600 HP, absorbs ice, is not Heavy, and inflicts poison.
* Form 3 has 1600 HP, absorbs fire, and inflicts blind.
* Form 4 has 1600 HP, absorbs lightning, is not Heavy, and inflicts paralysis.
* Form 5 has 2500 HP, absorbs wind+ice+fire+lightning, has previous attacks and charm, and literally has 0 physical defense.
* Magic-heavy teams may have to slowly and painfully knife the last form to death.
* [NIN] Water Scrolls are solid offense against the first four forms, since none absorb Water.
* [MNK] Killing any form with !Counter will skip the trigger that causes the next form to spawn, ending the fight immediately.
* Being able to pierce defense, whether with critical hits or axes, will reliably damage all five forms.
* [TIM] You can land Slow on every form, if you feel like it.
* [TIM] Gravity works on forms 2 and 4.
* [BLU] The first form is weak to Aera, or dies to Dark Spark -> Level 5 Death.
* [BLU] Death Claw works on forms 2 and 4.
* [BLU] Form 3 dies to 2x Dark Spark -> Level 5 Death, or Aerora it for mediocre damage.
* [BLU] The fifth form dies instantly to Level 5 Death.
* [BLU] Wow, blue mage is broken.
* [GEO] The first form dies in a blink, thanks to !Gaia always hitting its Wind weakness.
* [GEO] The next few take substantial damage from !Gaia as well, until its magic defense builds up.
* [SUM] Chocobo, your time is now! (It does physical damage, so it works on form 5).
* [SUM] ...Unless you're on the Matrix or Pixel versions, where they 'fixed' that.
* [BST] !Catch an Aegir outside Karnak before coming in here, then !Release a Ronkan Knight from in here, then !Release the Aegir.
* [BST] The Knight attacks for ~1560, then the Aegir inflicts Sap that will kill form 1, bypassing its counter script and ending the fight.
* [BST] Be sure not to do anything else, because you want to guarantee it dies to Sap.
* [BST] ...unless you're on Pixel, which fixed this. Just use Ronkan Knights instead then. Could use Bandersnatches for forms 2+4 if you prefer.

## Purobolos
* Quick reminder: if you're on Pixel, you HAVE TO read the note on the right table in the Catapault before going to Tycoon meteorite to talk to Cid.
* 1500 HP, 1/3 chance to cast Self-Destruct rather than fighting every third round, each casts Arise to revive the other five when killed.
* The easiest way to handle this is brute force with powerful AOEs to kill them all at once.
* Yup, that means rods.
* [BLU] If you don't want to just spam rods, Aqua Breath works pretty great here too.
* [BLU] Alternatively, you can Death Claw them all and then target-all with Aera.
* [SAM] !Zeninage will get the job done, albeit at a high gil cost because there are six targets.
* [NIN] !Throwing scrolls, especially if you have a magic ability to equip, will make quick work of them.
* [SUM] They look like they're Floating, but they're not. Titan away!
* [BST] Beastmasters can just !Control each Purobolos and have them Self-Destruct targeted on themselves to avoid Arise.
* [WHM] A Silenced Purobolos will not cast Arise upon death.
* [MYS] A Silence Bladed Purobolos will not cast Arise upon death.
* [TIM] The Time Mage's Mute spell will NOT stop Arise from going off.
* [TIM] Gravity will cut their HP enough to make Self-Destruct managable, however.
* [TIM] Purobolos is also vulnerable to Slow.
* [BRD] A Purobolos that's Stopped by Romeo's Ballad will not cast Arise upon death.
* [BER] This is another fight you might want to come in with a dead/blinded Berserker for.
* [BER] If that's not an option, you can roll the dice on Mage Masher silence procs.
* [CHM] You can drain all their MP with Lilith's Kiss, or Berserk them, to prevent the Self-Destructs and Arises both.
* [GEO] !Gaia fishing for Wind Slash should work just fine, unless you get unlucky.

## Titan
* 2500 HP. Has beefy physical attacks, but the main threat is Earth Shaker, which deals powerful (480-540) all-target damage.
* Also casts Earth Shaker on death, so you need to have a way to not wipe to that. Float is the best way.
* [WHM|RDM] White and Red Mages can cast Confuse on Gaelicats in the North Mountain to gain Float to nullify Earth Shaker.
* [DNC] Dancers can !Dance the Tempting Tango on Gaelicats in the North Mountain to gain Float to nullify Earth Shaker.
* [DNC] On Pixel, you can also use !Flirt to lock Titan down (with 50% accuracy) to prevent the final Earth Shaker.
* [BRD] Bards can !Sing Alluring Air on Gaelicats in the North Mountain to get Float to nullify Earth Shaker.
* [BRD] Stopping Titan with !Sing right before the killshot will dodge the Earth Shaker, but the timing is tight. Getting Float is better.
* [BST] Beastmasters can !Control Gaelicats in the North Mountain to gain Float to nullify Earth Shaker.
* [BST] If you're not worried about Earth Shaker, you can !Release a Sand Bear to nearly oneshot Titan.
* Don't use a Tent, Cottage, Inn, or healing pot after getting Float, because they remove the status.
* [CHM] Here's your introduction to the brokenness of !Mix. Antidote + Maiden's Kiss = Levisalve to gain Float to nullify Earth Shaker.
* [FRE] You can paralyze Titan with the Whip and then have someone else immediately deal the fatal blow to dodge the Earth Shaker, but the timing is tight.
* [THF+BER] If you have a Thief, a Berserker, and lots of patience, Titan's rare steal is a Gaia Hammer.
* [THF+BER] That's literally an endgame weapon, especially if you can back up its Earthquake procs with a magic ability to pass along a magic stat.
* [TIM] Titan is vulnerable to slow, which helps with the damage race portion of the fight.
* [TIM] If you have no better method, you can try to land Stop right before the killshot to dodge the final Earth Shaker, but the timing is tight.
* [SUM] Titan is vulnerable to the Remora summon's Paralyze. This is literally only time in the game it's useful.
* [SUM] With very, very good timing, you can avoid the last Earth Shaker using it right before the killshot.
* [MNK] Monks have innate Counter, and you can't counter a counter, so killing Titan with a Counter bypasses the final Earth Shaker.
* Failing any way to scam Earth Shaker, the only real alternative is to have enough HP to survive it.

## Manticore
* 3300 HP, not Heavy nor immune to instant death, alternates between (Fight or Aqua Breath) and (Blaze or Aqua Breath).
* [BST] Bandersnatches near Walse cast Blaster on !Release, which is 50/50 to instantly kill Manticore.
* [BST] Manticore is a Magic Beast, so !Calm will not work on GBA because it's bugged.
* [BER|FRE] Manticore isn't immune to instant death, so Death Sickle works.
* [RAN+THF] Manticore isn't immune to instant death, so if you stole a Killer Bow here's its time to shine!
* [BLU] Manticore isn't Heavy, so Death Claw works.
* [SAM] Manticore isn't Heavy, so !Iainuki technically works, but how the hell did you master Samurai already?
* [TIM] Between Stop and Slow, Manticore probably won't ever get a turn.
* [TIM] Manticore isn't Heavy, so you can also use Gravity.
* [BRD] With multiple Romeo's Ballad singers, Manticore probably won't ever get a turn.
* [DNC] Manticore isn't Heavy, so !Flirt works.
* [WHM|RDM] If you don't have any cheesier options, you can likely just heal through the multi-target spells with Cura.

## Things To Do Before You Leave World One
* Before you leave W1, make sure you have the following...
* Sufficient healing items to take on the Big Bridge Gilgamesh fight. There's a shop after that in Regole, and you can get infinite Tents very slowly from the Paos before the Bridge.
* Lix sells everything but Phoenix Downs half off, and goes away after W1.
* Speaking of, get a couple Phoenix Downs. You'll be really embarrassed if you have 0 and the one in the chest before Tyrannosaurus misses.
* The Elven Mantle from the basement of Walse, if you want it.
* [BRD] Romeo's Ballad and Alluring Air. They're permanently missable! And also they're two of the most useful songs.
* [BER|FRE] As many Death Sickles as you need from Crescent Island. They don't show up again until Fork Tower.
* [CHM] A stockpile of Turtle Shells to get you through until you can farm them again after Drakenvale.
* [CHM] The maximum number of Dark Matter you could want in W2 is six, if you want to Death Potion everything that is vulnerable to it, and you can't farm them until W3.
* [BST] The Blitz Whip in Jachol Cave is gone for a long time. If you want it, get it now.
* [NIN] Enough Scrolls and Shuriken to get you to Quelb. In practice, this is a few Thunder Scrolls for most of the Big Bridge, a few non-Thunder Scrolls for Neo Garula, and a few Shuriken for Gilgamesh.
* [BLU] Much of what you want you can't re-get right now, but don't miss out on Level 5 Death and Aera. Possibly also Flame Thrower, Vampire, Flash, Aqua Breath, Self-Destruct, and Missile.
* [BLU] Dark Spark and Death Claw show up again very soon, but you should have them anyway. If you didn't get Dark Spark, get it now.
* [BLU] If you don't have a better offensive option for Melusine, you actually want to pick up some spare Flame Rods now and hold onto them until W3. This is just a time-saver, not vital.
* [RDM|BLM] Get Toad now or wait until Phantom Village. It's not especially useful but it's your call.
* [WHM|RDM] Get Mini from the Catapult. It's not essential, but it's a long time before you can get it again and it's useful for weird things like Berserkers on the Crystals.
* [SUM] Get Shiva and Ramuh now or wait until literally before Twintania.

## World 2 Intro
* Every Pao fight drops a Tent. If you're willing to get talked to by Lenna repeatedly and were too poor earlier, you can stock up here.
* You don't need to win the fight against the Abductor on the Solitary Island.
* Pixel: You can walk to the forest to get prompted to rest and save using a tent here.
* [THF+SUM] You could theoretically try for the rare steal Gaia Gear, to get it one boss fight early. Don't bother.
* Remember that there's an infinite use Healing Spring in Exdeath's Castle, which a terminally underleveled Galuf might need.
* Almost no classes have real trouble with the solo fight against Gilgamesh, and you can pick the beefiest of your four.
* [BLU] If you missed Death Claw or Dark Spark in W1, you can get them from Treants and Strapparers respectively in the grasslands outside Exdeath's castle.

## Bridgamesh
* 6500 HP, and will cast all three of Haste, Protect, and Shell at 2500 HP remaining, then spam Jump.
* This fight is much, much easier if you can prevent the buffs from being cast.
* In the SNES version only, you can try getting lucky with a Mage Masher proc right as you push Gilgamesh below 2500.
* Otherwise, most parties can still win a DPS race against boosted Gilgamesh, if you're careful about when you push him.
* [WHM] Protect will let you safely slug it out against boosted Gilgamesh.
* [RDM|WHM] On SNES only, you can land Silence at the proper moment to prevent the buffs. Not on GBA or Matrix. Just SNES.
* [TIM] While he can't be silenced, the Mute spell works just fine.
* [TIM] Land Slow on him before Mute stops your spells as well to make the fight even easier.
* [BLU] Blue Mages can Magic Hammer their way through Gilgamesh's 1000 MP before taking him below 2500 HP, causing his buffs to fail.
* [BST] Beastmasters can deploy Bearagas saved from World 1, if you have any.
* [BLU+BST] Alternatively, 1000 Needles still does its fixed damage even after his buffs.
* [DRG] It'll take forever, but in the worst case scenario !Lance can be used to drain Gilgamesh's 1000 MP before taking him below 2500 HP, causing his buffs to fail.
* [DRG] It's likely better to just kill him through them, for your own sanity.
* [CHM] Chemists can mix Lilith's Kiss and Dark Ether to effortlessly drain Gilgamesh's 1000 MP before taking him below 2500 HP, causing his buffs to fail.
* [KGT|MYS|BLU|RDM|FRE] Gilgamesh is vulnerable to Old, which you can inflict via the Ancient Sword. It's not vital, but ultimately cuts his Jump damage in half.
* [SAM] !Zeninage doesn't care about Protect, so you'll inflict the same damage before and after the buffs. And if you're level 13+, it only takes two !Zeninage to kill after buffs.

## Regole
* Regole can get expensive, depending on your classes and whether you need to buy weapons.
* That said, the shops at Bal have everything that the shops here have, and between the two there's 11k gold and some items in Moogle Village.
* [GEO] This is an okay spot for Geomancer to farm - the swamps outside give Bottomless Bog !Gaia, which instantly kills all the enemies that appear there.
* [WHM] The magic store sells Blink and Shell, both of which are great for certain bosses.
* [BLM] The magic store sells Break and Bio. You won't get rods to boost Bio for another two towns, sadly.
* [MYS] The magic store sells Drain, Break, and Bio, giving you two and a half great !Spellblade options.
* [TIM] The magic store sells Comet (your Time Mage's first non-rod offensive spell!) and some other trash.
* [TIM+THF] You can use the Return spell to keep trying for annoying rare steals. It sucks, but it works!
* [CHM] This is the first chance for Chemists to stock up on Drink items.
* [CHM] You can use !Drink to Protect yourself, Haste yourself, and/or double your max HP for the rest of the fight.
* [CHM] It's no !Mix, but it's still more broken stuff than half of this game's classes get.
* [SUM] Summoners can buy Gaia Gear here, which boosts earth damage by 50%. Boosted Titans will be a Summoner's mainstay for a long time.
* [BRD] The sixth piano is in the Regole pub. Play it for your Bard.
* [BST] Beastmasters might want to consider making an early visit to the Sealed Castle.
* [BST] They can !Control the Shield Dragons in there for free kills (cast Blaze five times) to farm XP and ABP.
* [BST] Shield Dragons can also be easily captured for Almagest (~750 damage) by casting Blaze four times, which is fine if you're out of Bears.
* The undead dinosaur in the underground passage isn't even a real boss. Just throw a Phoenix Down (or two if you miss) and move on.
* [WHM|RDM] You can also cast Raise rather than using Phoenix Downs. Saves some gil, I guess.
* [CHM] The Resurrection !Mix (Phoenix Down + Potion) can't miss, unlike Phoenix Down. Spend the extra Potion to guarantee the kill - you'll feel stupid if you don't and miss.
* [CHM] For some reason, on Pixel, Resurrection can miss.
* In the Moogle Village, you can get the Dancing Dagger, which is primarily useful for giving every party access to a confuse effect.
* [BLU] Now your Blue Mage can learn most !Control-only spells, even without a Beastmaster!

## Bal/Drakenvale
* Let's get this out of the way. Objets d'Art in the basement of Bal Castle give very little XP, but lots of gil and ABP.
* They can be instantly killed by using a Gold Needle on them, are vulnerable to Death, and are also weak to lightning.
* [BLU] Blue Mages can simply vaporize them with Level 5 Death, which makes grinding much less tedious.
* [NIN] Thunder Scrolls are effective enough to be faster than Gold Needles.
* [SUM] Later in the area you'll find a random encounter with Golem being harassed by undead dragons. If you win the fight, you get Golem as a summon.
* [THF] Thieves can rarely steal Twin Lances from them, which is the best weapon they'll get for a long time.
* [SAM] While you don't have it yet (hopefully), !Iainuki works on them. Bit of a cat-and-mouse issue given that it takes 605 ABP or whatever to get it.
* [CHM] Chemists are the only class that can equip the hidden Angel Robe above the item shop in Bal Castle.
* [TIM] Time Mages should get the Teleport spell in the 'hidden' chest just south of the visible chest in Bal Castle's throne room.
* [KGT|MYS] The hidden Great Sword in the moat of Bal Castle (right side dead end, bottom corner, face left and press A) is the best sword you're gonna get for quite a while, and free to boot.
* [BRD] You can pick up Requiem in Quelb from the werewolves running in a circle in the top-right.
* [BRD] Requiem deals massive damage to undead monsters. Quite handy for the next area and many to come.
* [BST] You can get the Kornago Gourd from the man in the well on the left side of Quelb in return for 10,000 gil and a !Catch'd Kornago.
* [BST] It lets you !Catch monsters at half HP rather than 1/8, which ranges from very useful to completely mandatory (Crystelles in the final dungeon have 3 HP and are good for NED.)
* Drakenvale itself has some fantastic loot.
* The Dragon Zombies here are tough, but can be easily defeated by Phoenix Downs or other anti-undead measures.
* They always drop Dragon Fangs, which sell for 2500 gil each!
* [CHM] Dragon Fangs are also invaluable for endgame Chemist shenanigans; you'll want to grind a few of them.
* [CHM] If you plan on killing Omega with a solo Chemist, you'll want around 40-50.
* [CHM] If you don't have a better way to kill Dragon Zombies than with items, Resurrection (Phoenix Down+Potion) can't miss but Phoenix Down can.
* [BST] Beastmasters should make sure they get the Hypno Crown here, which doubles the success rate of !Control.
* The big prize is the Bone Mail, which you can find hidden on a skeleton near the top of Drakenvale.
* It's a medium armor with sky-high physical defense and immunities to death, poison, old, confuse, and berserk.
* It also makes the wearer undead, so healing magic hurts them instead and instant death effects fully heal them instead.
* You can also get around this with elemental absorb. Flame Rings are particularly good since Bone Mail also gives a fire weakness!
* [BLU] The Blue Mage's White Wind spell still heals Bone Mail wearers, because !Blue wasn't good enough already.
* [MYS] Drain !Spellblade still heals Bone Mail wearers, because !Spellblade wasn't good enough already.
* Bone Mail is best against random encounters, bosses that mostly attack physically, or bosses that mostly use status spells.

## Dragon Pod
* 12000 HP, summons 100 HP Dragon Flowers that inflict various status effects.
* Most parties will either clear Flowers repeatedly with AoE or abuse the Pod's vulnerability to instant death.
* Worst case scenario, the Bone Mail shuts down almost everything this fight can do for one lucky wearer.
* Only the second Flower from the left inflicts an ailment that the Bone Mail doesn't nullify (paralyze).
* The Flowers themselves have no status immunities, which is nice to know if you have to rely on the Bone Mail.
* [MNK] This battle is probably the Monk's last gasp at viability. !Kick's time to shine is repeatedly clearing 100 HP idiots.
* [BLM|SUM|NIN] Powerful target-all spells (or scrolls) will keep the Pod stuck resummoning its Flowers every turn.
* [BLM] The Flowers are also vulnerable to Sleep, though there's likely no reason to bother when you can just AoE them every turn.
* [BLU] The Dragon Pod isn't Heavy, so you can just end this fight with a Death Claw.
* [BER] If you can clear out the Flowers to keep them on-target, your Berserker will eventually kill the Pod with a Death Sickle.
* [BST] Aquathorn from the swamps around Bal casts an instant death spell when !Released. It's only single-target, so kill the flowers first.
* [BST] If you don't want to walk out, you can !Catch a Bone Dragon right here, which casts Bone to take a single target down to single-digit HP.
* [MYS] Drain Sword bypasses the no-healing property of Bone Mail, allowing for an effortless Mystic Knight solo.
* [CHM] Death Potion works on the Dragon Pod.
* [BRD] Bards can Stop all the Flowers (and the central Pod) at once with Romeo's Ballad.
* [DNC] The Dragon Pod isn't heavy, so you can lock it down with !Flirt.
* [RAN|FRE] The Killer Bow works on the Dragon Pod.
* [SAM] !Iainuki will cut the Dragon Pod right in half, if you have it.
* [SAM] If not, the Wind Slash katana will clear the Flowers every time its Wind Slash ability procs (12.5%).
* [SAM] !Zeninage will be very expensive here, but everything has 0 defense if you're absolutely loaded with gil.
* [GEO] !Gaia is quite likely to use Earthquake here, which will kill the Flowers.
* [RDM|WHM] You can neuter the Flowers by Confusing them.
* [RDM] You can also snap rods to clear the Flowers.
* [TIM] The Dragon Pod isn't heavy, so you can Gravity it repeatedly and snap one rod for the kill. Rod snapping also clears the Flowers.

## Surgate
* You can visit Surgate Castle at this point, but most parties shouldn't bother.
* [BRD] Bards, however, can learn the incredible Swift Song from a book in King Xezat's bedroom.
* [TIM] Time Mages can find the Float spell at Surgate, just in time for Exdeath.
* [TIM] Help the librarian reshelve the books, then follow them back and ultimately open a chest for Float.
* [DRG] The Surgate weapon shop has Heavy Lances, for when the elemental lances you already have don't work.
* [CHM] This is also your earliest opportunity to farm Turtle Shells again in W2.
* [CHM] The best spot is south of Moore, on a small strip of land immediately south of the mountains.

## Boatamesh & Enkidu
* 8888 HP, mixes up physicals with Missile and Death Claw. Summons Enkidu at 4000 HP.
* Enkidu has 4000 HP and uses various blue magic, including the completely infuriating White Wind.
* Kill Enkidu first, but watch out for his ability to cast Vampire for obscene damage and self-healing while you do.
* [BLU] Gilgamesh is level 31. Dark Spark -> L5 Death can end this fight before Enkidu shows up.
* [BER] Gilgamesh isn't immune to instant death. Death Sickle him before Enkidu shows up.
* [RAN] Gilgamesh isn't immune to instant death. Killer Bow him before Enkidu shows up.
* [FRE] Gilgamesh isn't immune to instant death. Killer Bow or Death Sickle him before Enkidu shows up.
* [CHM] Gilgamesh isn't immune to instant death. Death Potion him before Enkidu shows up.
* [SAM] Enkidu is neither heavy nor immune to instant death. You can use !Iainuki, if you have it, though it doesn't get Gilgamesh.
* [TIM] Both Gilgamesh and Enkidu are vulnerable to Slow.
* [MYS] Mystic Knights can nail Gilgamesh with a Silence !Spellblade, but it won't turn off his Blue Magic. So don't bother.
* [THF] You can steal a Genji Glove from Gilgamesh, if you have anyone who can equip heavy armor.
* [BST] You can !Control Enkidu. A self-targeted Hurricane works just fine.
* [BST] You can also hit Gilgamesh with an Aquathorn, just like you did Dragon Pod, and skip Enkidu altogether.

## Barrier Tower
* Anyone with a caster should make sure to get the Gold Hairpin in a trapped chest on the left side of Floor 9, which halves MP consumption.
* [BLU] Blue Mages can learn Time Slip from Travelers, though it's of somewhat limited utility since it requires targets to be vulnerable to both Sleep and Old.
* [BLU] Level Trickers can cast Level 4 Graviga here, if you missed it from Ronka. But also, it's basically useless, so whatever.
* [THF] Thieves can rare steal Flame Rings from the Red Dragons in the Gold Hairpin and Blood Sword chests.
* [THF] Remember, you can flee from a monster-in-a-box to reset the encounter if your steal fails.
* [THF] ...or if you're crazy and want 4 of them, or even more to sell for gil, all while grinding out escapes for the Chicken Knife.
* Almost every party should farm Reflect Knights for their Reflect Ring drops here. You'll likely need them for World 2 Exdeath.
* The best place to farm them is outside between floors 5 and 6, but if you need to return to the sub to heal frequently the balcony between 3 and 4 is pretty good too.
* [BLU] You have L2 Old -> L5 Death to kill W2 Exdeath, and can safely skip Reflect Rings altogether. Maybe get one for Catastrophe.
* [BST] You have !Release to kill W2 Exdeath, and can safely skip Reflect Rings altogether. Maybe get one for Catastrophe.
* [CHM] Since you have Chemist, you don't need Reflect Rings for W2 Exdeath, though they're still nice. Be sure to get one if you're going to go toe-to-toe with Omega via !Mix.
* [BLM] Drain bypasses Reflect, so you can farm your first Reflect Ring with Drain and then bounce Breaks off your own party for the rest.
* [THF] No point in Thieves farming Reflect Rings here. You can steal them from Carbuncle and Reflect Mages more easily before you need them.
* [MYS] You can kill Reflect Knights with Break Blade. Reflect Rings are easy for you!
* [TIM] You can kill Reflect Knights with Comet. Reflect Rings are not very difficult for you!

## Atomos
* 19997 HP, spams Comet until someone dies, then starts sucking them in.
* You can come in with someone dead to skip the Comets, or just leave one party member dead after them.
* Revive your corpse just before they move far enough to the left to get eaten and let Atomos kill someone else to buy more time. This fight is hard to lose.
* [BLU] Dark Spark -> Level 5 Death ends the fight.
* [BLU] You can inflict Sleep with Time Slip on Pixel, but not on other versions because Atomos is immune to Old.
* [BLM|MYS|RDM] Atomos is weak to Sleep, and then you can kill it without waking it up.
* [KGT|FRE] You can attack with the Sleep Blade to put Atomos to sleep, then kill it if you have any magical damage (including rod snaps!) Otherwise, it doesn't really matter.
* [BST] !Releasing a Lesser Lopros from the river by the Moogle Village will deal 5000 damage with Breath Wing.
* [BST] Four of them will kill Atomos.
* [BST] It's also magical damage, in case you're using Sleep strats and don't have !Catch on everyone yet.
* Most parties without access to Sleep or !Blue can simply win a DPS race here.
* [BRD] The Dream Harp doesn't work on Heavy targets, like Atomos. But you have Swift Song to buff the rest of your party!

## Post-Submarine Questing
* To advance the plot, take the submarine to visit Ghido's Cave.
* The correct order for the rock chest puzzle is top left, then press the switch, then bottom left, and continue.
* [BLU] While you're there, learn Aeroga from the Enchanted Fan Metamorph, most common on the floor called B3, in the first room with hidden passages.
* [BLU] It's by far the most reliable option for Blue Mages to do straight damage, and boosted by the Air Knife.
* Your staff users may appreciate the Staff of Light that is 1/16 to drop from Metamorphs.
* Metamorphs will only drop this while in their base (old man) form. No transforms allowed.
* Farming copies to snap may make W2 Exdeath much easier, but it's also completely mind-numbing.
* Metamorphs are weak to Wind, so you can equip Air Knives from the Moore weapon shop and just beat 'em up.
* [SUM] Summoners will want to stop by the Northern Island to fight Catoblepas.
* [SUM] Catoblepas has only 5000 HP and only attacks with weak physicals or Drain.
* [SUM] However, it also counterattacks with Petrify. Don't be afraid to stop attacking long enough to Gold Needle your team.
* [SUM] HP Sap like, say, what a Summoner can inflict by snapping a Venom Rod, gets around this.
* [CHM] If you're running low on Turtle Shells for your Chemist, the best farming spot is the small patch of land just south of Moore, outside the mountains.
* [CHM] The 3x Land Turtle encounters here drop more Turtle Shells to fuel your Succubus Kiss habit.

## Moore
* There's a second Main Gauche in Moore, if you want it. It's in a barrel behind the pub.
* [BLU] Air Knives boost wind damage by 50%, making them immediately useful for Blue Mages.
* [SUM] Summoners should pick up Air Knives either now or in early W3, since they boost Syldra's damage to make it your strongest summon.
* [GEO] Air Knives boost wind damage, useful for the guaranteed !Gaia Wind Slash on NED... and, uh, a few random other spots.
* [WHM] Curaga, Berserk, and Reflect all allow you to cheese fights in various hilarious ways.
* [BLM] Firaga, Thundaga, and Blizzaga. Yep.
* [MYS] Firaga, Thundaga, and Blizzaga really supercharge !Spellblade.
* [TIM] The various spells Time Mages can learn here are nice, but the real winner is Hastega.
* [BRD] Bards will be happy to find the seventh piano in Moore's pub.
* [BLU] You may want to learn Lilliputian Lyric from Mini Magicians in the Forest, but you'll never use it unless you have Berserker and dislike murdering your own party.
* You'll have to make a choice here between the Aegis Shield and the Flame Shield.
* Since you have literally any shield user, you want the Aegis Shield, which is infinitely better.

## Seal Crystals/Guardians
* 7777 HP each, not Heavy, 20% magic evasion and level 77 to make it difficult to hit with inaccurate spells.
* Each Crystal switches from attacking to casting a spell at 3000 HP remaining.
* The top one casts Firaga, the left Aeroga, the bottom Earth Shaker, and the right Aqua Breath.
* (Remember you can get Float from using the Dancing Dagger's Tempting Tango on Poison Eagles after feeding them an Ether on the bridge screen in Drakenvale.)
* Each Crystal also absorbs attacks of its element, and all four nullify Ice/Lightning/Holy/Poison.
* In general, avoid all-target attacks unless you think you can kill all affected Crystals in one cycle.
* Parties with reasonable offenses can simply get a Crystal close to 3000 HP and try to kill it quickly.
* On SNES and GBA, if you can, put Bone Mail on Galuf to save yourself some time in the next fight.
* [BLU] Death Claw, when it gets through their magic evasion, takes a Crystal down to single-digit HP.
* [BLU] While the Crystals can be blinded, that's probably not the best use of your time.
* [BER] Death Sickle procs will work, though watch out for dealing too much damage if you don't get procs early.
* [BER] Consider using the Mini Magicians outside to Mini your Berserker, which reduces their damage but doesn't stop the Death proc.
* [BER+WHM] Or just use your own Mini spell. Obviously.
* [BER+RDM] Or just use your own Mini spell. Obviously.
* [WHM] Shell means you have a lot less to worry about from the spellcasting phase.
* [SAM] The Crystals have 10 defense, but that's not enough to protect them from !Zeninage.
* [SAM] You can also use !Iainuki if you've managed to grind it out.
* [MYS] The Crystals are NOT vulnerable to Break. Sorry, Death !Spellblade doesn't exist.
* [CHM] Death Potion works on the Crystals. This is why you probably farmed Prototypes in World 1.
* [BRD] Swift Song will eventually make a noticeable difference in a damage race against a spellcasting Crystal.
* [BST] Sandcrawlers from the desert outside Moogle Village !Release to cast Maelstrom, which has a 40.8% chance of putting each Crystal down to single-digit HP.
* [BST] Obviously, don't release one until you're prepared to follow up with pokes to finish the vulnerable Crystals off.
* [TIM] While the Crystals are high level and have some amount of Magic Evade, they ARE vulnerable to Gravity spells.
* [TIM] Gravity deals low enough damage to not knock the Crystal into spellcasting phase, so the correct order is Gravity -> Graviga -> Comet.
* [TIM] You can spend 'extra' turns trying to land the initial Gravity on the other Crystals while you wait for Graviga to hit, as long as you're always prepared to Comet immediately afterwards.
* [TIM] The Crystals are also vulnerable to Slow, to make this tactic even safer.
* [SUM] Get Float from a Poison Eagle on the bridge screen in Drakenvale via the Dancing Dagger's Tempting Tango after feeding it an Ether.
* [SUM] Then go into the fight, wait for ATB bars to fill, cast three Titans with Gaia Gear on, wait for full bars again, four.
* [SUM] This should kill all the non-Earth crystals, and at that point you've won because you have Float. Chip it down.
* [RAN|FRE] High level and magic evasion doesn't do anything to stop Killer Bow procs.
* [RAN|FRE] You can blind the Crystals with a Dark Bow, but that's wasted turns that could have been Killer Bow attacks. It's relatively easy, but if you're not dying to the attack damage, don't bother.
* [RAN|FRE] If you find you're pushing the Crystals into casting range fishing for Killer Bow procs, reset and let a Mini Magician outside (or your own White or Red Mage if applicable) make you Mini first.
* [RAN|FRE] Or just use Hi-Potions on them. That's my preferred strat.
* If you did put Bone Mail on Galuf, and you're on SNES/GBA, have him use a Phoenix Down on himself against Exdeath.
* Otherwise, you have to actually deal damage. So don't come in on Healing Staff White Mage or Mini Berserker or something.
* [BLU] If you're on SNES/GBA, Self-Destruct also ends the fight instantly.

## Exdeath's Castle
* To save yourself time in world 3 and open up some Triple Crown options, farm a Power Staff drop from Black Warlocks.
* It casts Berserk on hit, which has a number of obscure but quite useful applications. Especially on Shinryu.
* [THF] Your Thief can also rare steal a Judgment Staff from those same Black Warlocks. It casts Dispel when used. You likely don't care, but might.
* Shield-users will appreciate the Ice Shield in a chest here... or at least they would, if not for the Aegis Shield.
* Still, if you have multiple shield-users, it's the next best option so far.
* [BLU] Magic Dragons cast three Blue Magic spells you theoretically could have, but may have missed.
* [BLU] Aeroga, Off-Guard, and Level 2 Old were all annoying to obtain the first time around, if even possible for your team.
* [BLU] On GBA, quicksaving on floor 4 will give you an uncommon encounter with three Magic Dragons and some trash, to up your odds.
* [BLU] Without prior confusion access, using Tempting Tango from the Dancing Dagger on a Hellraiser is your first chance to get White Wind as well.
* [TIM] Float will let you safely get over the lava in the castle, which is nice and convenient! Just remember using a Tent or Cottage will remove it.
* [GEO] Having a Geomancer lets you avoid the damage from the lava. With how large the damage is, it almost makes having the class completely worth it for the whole run.
* [RAN] You'll have to walk through the lava to get the Hayate Bow here. Consider Quicksave to do it safely on GBA without Time or Geo. Even without that, it's worth it.
* [RAN+BER] ...Especially if you put Equip Bows on a Berserker and give it to them.
* [KGT] The Icebrand isn't very good, but in conjuction with your new Ice Shield it lets your Knight heal themselves.
* [NIN|THF] Ninjas and Thieves will appreciate the Twin Lance weapon in a chest near the end, especially if it's your best Chicken Knife option.
* [SUM] Summoners can get the Carbuncle summon by defeating it in a boss fight just before the final save point.
* [SUM] Carbuncle is really sturdy, but transforms into a weaker healing form after casting 3 spells on you.
* [SUM] The healing form is not Heavy and is vulnerable to Stone. Just wait to see Cura and then cast Catoblepas.
* [THF] Lazy people with a Thief may want to fight Carbuncle, because it has two common steal Reflect Rings, one from each form.
* [THF] Reflect Mages, common on floor 3, have a rare steal Reflect Ring and no common steal. Here's your farming place for the rest of the party!
* For the floor puzzle with the skull trapdoors, use this handy picture: https://www.cavesofnarshe.com/ff5/images/walkthrough/trapfloor.png

## Castlemesh
* 13000 effective HP, spams the same old Blue Magic + new status aliments.
* Totally optional, if you don't need the Genji Helmet and, later, the Genji Armor.
* He won't show up in the Void or to help you fight Necrophobe if you skip this, though.
* This fight's not difficult enough to bother doing anything fancy. Just attack him and heal if needed.
* [BST] Beastmasters can go downstairs and !Catch a Yellow Dragon, which will carve off 9999 HP thanks to Gilgamesh's inflated true HP total.
* [DRG] Don't forget the Partisan in a chest to the right of the Gilgamesh room. It's the highest-power spear you can get at this point, and also not elemental.
* [NIN] Don't forget the free Fuma Shuriken in a chest to the right of the Gilgamesh room.

## W2 Exdeath
* 32768 HP; phase transitions at 16000 and 7000 HP remaining.
* Classes without a strong way to cheese this fight should bring Reflect Rings from Barrier Tower.
* If you're foregoing Reflect Rings, don't have anyone with a level divisible by 3, unless you want them to die to Level 3 Flare.
* If you are bringing Reflect Rings, going in with a level divisible by 3 is actively good!
* Parties with weak healing options (or anyone, honestly) should consider reading Exdeath's AI script to be ready for Zombie Breath, which wipe a party at low HP.
* [WHM] Make sure you keep Protect up; Exdeath's Vacuum Wave physicals are nasty.
* [WHM] Remember that you can't actually heal party members with a Reflect Ring, unless you have a way to also put Reflect on Exdeath.
* [WHM] Setting Berserk on your own physical characters can help with the mad rush to take his last 7000 HP.
* [BLU] Level 2 Old works. If you know the timing well (once it lands, get six Can't Run messages), you can cast Level 5 Death at the right time to end the fight.
* [BLU] That said, you may also want to consider stalling the first form long enough to learn Level 3 Flare. I personally don't but if you want to, that's cool too.
* [BST+BLU] If you bothered to get Level 3 Flare before this fight, it's solid damage when you use it.
* [TIM] Do not use Slow. Exdeath will counter with Haste, which overwrites Slow instead of just cancelling it.
* [TIM] Do use Float on your party to avoid Earth Shaker; even if Exdeath uses 100 Gs it just wastes a turn (and you can recast Float.)
* [TIM+WHM] If you can Reflect Exdeath and bounce a Slow off your own party, the resulting Haste counter bounces off too.
* [SUM] Make sure you keep Golem up; Exdeath's Vacuum Wave physicals are nasty.
* [BST] !Releasing four Yellow Dragons (8192 damage each) does 100% total.
* [NIN] Consider !Throwing the Excalipoor and the Fuma Shuriken from two floors down to get through Exdeath's last 7000 HP.
* [MYS] Mystic Knights may have luck applying Drain Sword and just trying to DPS race.
* [BRD] Going Super Saiyan on Exdeath with Swift Song is technically possible but tricky. Watch out for Condemn.
* [BRD] On SNES and GBA, you can use !Hide to very, very slowly deplete Exdeath's MP. Doesn't work on Pixel and should, in general, be a strat of last resort.
* [CHM] Dragon's Kiss (Dragon Fang + Maiden's Kiss) blocks Condemn, allowing you to buff up in peace.
* [CHM] Exdeath is weak to Holy; chugging a Goliath Tonic and then spamming Holy Breath (Dragon Fang + Holy Water) works well.
* Staff-wielding parties can grind for Staves of Light in Ghido's Cave; snapping them does about 4000 damage per Staff.
* This also takes forever and should very much be treated as a last resort - that said, it can be useful to quickly push Exdeath below 16000 for the phase change.
* If you're still relying on the Healing Staff, remember that it won't work on anyone wearing a Reflect Ring.
* [WHM+RAN] !Rapid Fire works with Staff of Light physical attacks. This obscurely specific tip sounds like a joke, but it isn't.
* [CHM+RAN] !Rapid Fire works with Staff of Light physical attacks. This obscurely specific tip sounds like a joke, but it isn't.
* [CHM+RAN] Staff of Light attacks are also boosted by the Elemental Power !Mix. Go for it!
* Consider carefully what you give your Aegis Shield user; if things start going south they will likely be the one responsible for saving the fight.

## Antlion
* 8100 HP, Bartz and Krile only.
* This fight can be a pain with slow offense, since it'll spam Dischord to halve your level repeatedly.
* [WHM] Berserk (which Antlion is vulnerable to) and Blink combine to make this fight trivial.
* [BLM|MYS|RDM] Antlion is vulnerable to Sleep. Problem solved.
* [RAN] Antlion is vulnerable to Blind from the Dark Bow. You still have to deal damage, but Rangers can do that even at level 1.
* [FRE] Antlion is vulnerable to Blind from the Dark Bow, Old from the Ancient Sword, Berserk from the Power Staff...
* [FRE] ...and Sleep from the Sleep Blade, so just Sleep it and snap rods. But the previous three do combine to make this fight trivial even without that.
* [KGT] All of Antlion's damage comes from physical attacks. Just use !Guard.
* [KGT] You can also inflict Old with the Ancient Sword if you want to add insult to injury. You probably shouldn't bother.
* [BST] If you didn't plan ahead, the only available !Release is 1016 damage from the Goblin in the trapped chest in Tule's training house.
* [BST] If you genuinely don't have a better option, make sure to grab a spare !Release in W2 rather than four-shotting Exdeath with Yellow Dragons.
* [BST] ...You almost certainly have a better option. Even Whip !Attacks.
* [BLU] 1000 Needles isn't affected by your levels. 9 (or 8 and a plink) will kill even if you get knocked down to level 1.
* [BLU] Antlion is vulnerable to Old, Sleep, and Blind, so Time Slip is great and Flash isn't half bad either.
* [TIM] Comet provides a source of level-independent damage.
* [TIM] Antlion is vulnerable to Old and Slow, so you can weaken it before you Comet it into oblivion.
* [TIM] You can attack with the Power Staff from Exdeath's Castle, if you farmed one, to inflict Berserk as well.
* [CHM] You can attack with the Power Staff from Exdeath's Castle, if you farmed one, to inflict Berserk. This saves you having to Mix it. I guess.
* [NIN] Antlion is weak to water, so Water Scrolls have another little day in the sun here.

## Did You Get The Chicken Knife?????
* I've put an entire section here to remind you to get the Chicken Knife.
* It's in a hidden passage behind the shed next to the Pub in Moore. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/315364487882342401/738801781206679653/chickenbrave.png
* If you play like I do, the Chicken Knife is probably at 127 power already.
* Otherwise, just run away from fights until it is. If you left the Goblin chest in the Tule beginner's house alone, that's ideal.
* [BRD] Also at this time, don't forget to pick up Mana's Paean on the top floor of the Library. It's very easy to miss this one forever.
* [KGT|FRE|GLD] You could, theoretically, get the Brave Blade and use it. But don't, unless maybe there's a toxx in the thread to raise charity cash.
* [KGT|FRE] That said, on Pixel, you can run at least a few times and the Blade will regenerate to full power...

## The Great Pyramid
* To get in, you'll have to beat two Gargoyles with 5000 HP each which use physical attacks.
* If one is dead when the other gets a turn, it will revive at full HP, so you need to kill both nearly-simultaneously or use debilitating effects.
* Gargoyles are vulnerable to instant death, Sleep, Paralyze, Berserk, Stop, and Slow. (But they're heavy, so Paralyze and Stop don't last long.)
* For subsequent rematches, you can use the Magic Lamp to run through Bahamut, Leviathan (sadly not Odin) and Syldra for enough AoE damage to usually kill both.
* [BLU] Blue Mages can use Level 3 Flare to kill both Gargoyles.
* [WHM] Gargoyles are vulnerable to Berserk, and that prevents them from reviving each other.
* With a Power Staff, you can take advantage of the Gargoyles' vulnerability to Berserk even without access to the spell Berserk.
* [BST] You don't have good !Catch options yet, but you can !Release Bulettes for ~4000 to a single random target.
* [BST] Four of them will kill both Gargoyles, so wait until all your ATB bars are full.
* [THF|NIN|TIM] The Zephyrus encounters in here can be run from, but it takes forever naturally, so !Flee and !Smoke and the Teleport spell are really good.
* [BRD] Many of the random encounters in here are Undead, making Requiem very handy.
* [BER] The Earth Hammer, an axe you can find here, has a Quake proc that runs off your magic, so it's very powerful with a mage secondary skill.
* [BER] On the SNES only, equipping the Thornlet will underflow a Berserker's Magic to 253, making Quake insanely powerful.
* [DNC|FRE] Another Ribbon can be found in a chest late in the Pyramid.
* [CHM|CAN] There are total of six Dark Matters in chests here, which should be enough to get you through the rest of the game.
* [CHM|CAN] If you need more, Prototype Island close to Crescent is still around.

## Melusine
* 20000 HP, swaps between fire/ice/thunder/physical weaknesses, always beginning weak to fire.
* When in elemental-weak form, has lots of physical defense and spams the NON-WEAK elements at party.
* When in physical-weak form, has 0 physical defense and 0 physical evasion.
* Your Chicken Knife wielder will always be able to pierce the physical defense.
* Reflect Rings make it nearly impossible to die, but mean Melusine occasionally self-heals.
* [RDM|WHM] Congratulations, you've found the one time in the game the !White spell Libra is theoretically useful.
* [RDM|WHM] Melusine is also vulnerable to both Silence and Confuse. Go wild.
* [WHM] Even beyond that, you have Shell. You can't lose.
* [BLU] The Blue Mage !Scan ability will let you determine the current weakness, if you care.
* [BLU] Aqua Breath is non-elemental, giving you a way to hit all three magic-vulnerable forms.
* [BLU] Also, Flame Rods exist. Just break those and you'll win before the first weakness swap. No need to cast Flame Thrower, since it's just weaker.
* [BLU] 1000 Needles will do 1000 to every form, even the one that has very high magic defense.
* [TIM] Melusine is vulnerable to both Slow and Stop.
* [TIM] Also, Flame Rods exist. Just break those and you'll win before the first weakness swap.
* [MYS] Silence Blade will always work on Melusine, which makes the fight easy to burn down.
* [MYS] Sleep Blade also always works, which is even easier.
* [MYS] Firaga Blade is guaranteed to hit her weakness for the first three rounds of the fight and may even do 9999 per hit, which is even easier than that.
* [BLM] Melusine is vulnerable to Sleep, but you can probably deal 20k with Firaga spam before the first weakness swap.
* [BST] Bulettes in the desert !Release to Attack for about 4000 damage. It's not great, but there's no better option this early in World 3.
* [RAN] !Rapid Fire ignores enemy defense; spamming it with the Chicken Knife lets you ignore the actual mechanics here.
* [RAN] (also, most of the rest of the game)
* [KGT] If you're not the Chicken Knife wielder, swap between Flametongue, Icebrand, and Coral Sword for best damage output.
* [NIN] You can move the Chicken Knife to another melee class and still deal decent damage with !Throw here.
* [BRD] Alluring Air can confuse Melusine, which works as well as you think.
* [BRD] Romeo's Ballad also works, although not for very long. You can probably get a soft lock with three dedicated !Singers.
* [SUM] While you certainly can spam Ifrit, you might be better served using your other jobs' strategies or breaking rods.
* [CHM] Take advantage of Melusine's 0 magic defense in all three elemental forms and spam Succubus Kiss.
* Defense-piercing critical hits and Axes and !Rapid Fire all work well against the elemental forms.

## Sealed Castle
* Try not to die to the Exdeath's Soul and Shield Dragon encounters in the lobby, they're a cut above most encounter trash.
* You'll have the choice of 3 legendary weapons at first in the Sealed Castle, plus 3 more per tablet.
* The Assassin's Dagger is the only truly multiclass one, but it's excellent (if nothing else, it murders Twintania).
* [FRE] Freelancer gets to go shopping here. Take the Dagger in your first set (probably), but you have so many of options! In rough order of power:
* [FRE] Masamune is dumb dumb dumb. Guaranteed initiative + use to cast Haste. Especially funny with !Flee or !Smoke.
* [FRE] Excalibur has the highest Power of any easily obtainable weapon and is Holy elemental, which is usually upside (but not against Shinryu or Minotaur.)
* [FRE] The Rune Axe runs off your not-Berserker-level magic, so it just hits like a truck and ignores a bunch of defense for no reason.
* [FRE] Yoichi's Bow hits hard, and its 30% critical hit rate ignores defense when it procs. Doesn't do anything fancy, but does murder.
* [FRE] Apollo's Harp is really good against dragons, so you may want it with your second+ set of tablets. Shinryu is the notable target here.
* [FRE] Sasuke's Katana has pretty high attack power and a 1/3 physical attack block rate, like a Main Gauche on steroids.
* [FRE] The Sage's Staff is Holy elemental like Excalibur, and can be used to infinitely cast Raise for free.
* [FRE] The Magus Rod boosts every element, which does fuck-all for Freelancer on its own. If you want this, you already know you want this.
* [FRE] The Holy Lance is like Excalibur, except strictly worse. The Fire Lash sucks. The Gaia Bell is worse.
* [KGT] Excalibur has the highest Power of any easily obtainable weapon and is Holy elemental. No-brainer for Knights.
* [NIN] Sasuke's Katana is really good, especially if your Ninja isn't your Chicken Knife user. High power and a 1/3 physical attack block rate.
* [DRG] The Holy Lance is a solid option for your dragoon, though Dragoon is kind of a falling-off class at this point.
* [DRG] Just don't use it against Shinryu (or Minotaur) because it's Holy elemental, and they absorb that.
* [BER] The Rune Axe is a mediocre choice for your Berserker...unless you have a magic-using secondary ability, in which case it's amazing.
* [SAM] Masamune is dumb dumb dumb. Guaranteed initiative + use to cast Haste. Especially funny with !Flee or !Smoke. Get it.
* [RAN] Yoichi's Bow's selling point is its defense ignoring proc... but !Rapid Fire does that too. Sorry, friend.
* [RAN] That said, its power makes it the second-best weapon for a ranger after the Chicken Knife, so you likely still want it.
* [BRD] Apollo's Harp is kind of niche, but it's not a bad choice for your third weapon if you have no better options.
* [BRD+CHM] Chemists have the ability to turn things into dragons so Apollo's Harp can wreck them, which is both funny and surprisingly powerful.
* Any rod-using class can equip the Magus Rod, but it's best on Black or Red Mages because of its omni-elemental boosts.
* (Summoners can still use the Air Knife to boost Syldra if someone else needs the rod).
* Very few staff-using classes have a use for the Sage's Staff beyond the free Raise casts, frankly.
* [WHM] It does boost Holy damage for your White Mage, so when you get Holy it's your best weapon.
* [CHM] Attacking with the Sage's Staff lets you butcher Exdeath's Souls right outside for Dark Matter drops.
* [BST] The Fire Lash is basically garbage, though it out-performs the other two end-game whips if they're not hitting a monster-type weakness.
* [GEO] The Gaia Bell is actually garbage.
* [GLD] Don't forget that Gladiator can wield Excalibur! Make it happen.
* [GLD] It can also wield the Holy Lance! It's like Excalibur, except strictly worse without !Jump.
* [CAN] Your awesome GBA job does not care about any of these weapons. It's still awesome.
* [ORC] You can use the Sage's Staff just as well as anyone else that isn't a White Mage!
* [ORC] ...as in, poorly.

## Aviation
* There are a lot of interesting things to do now that you have a working Airship.
* First, let's get a stupid sidequest out of the way and ride Boko around the world! Start from where you parked him near Ghido's Cave, then do a full loop.
* Also take Boko all the way to the top of Istory Falls to find the Magic Lamp, which can one-shot part of the final boss.
* It summons a !Summon when used in battle, starting from the strongest and going in descending order until it just makes Chocobos forever.
* Examine the waterfall again to recharge the Lamp and restart from the top of its order if you want to use it for multiple bosses.
* Hidden in a forest on an island to the south, you can visit the Phantom Village.
* [WHM] Arise and Dispel will both come in handy in upcoming boss fights.
* [BLM] Black Mages get the short end of the stick here, 'only' learning Death and Osmose.
* [TIM] Quick is obscene, even without Venom Rod abuse. Just bring a Gold Hairpin.
* [BRD] The eighth and final piano is carefully hidden behind a secret passage in the basement. Sneaky!
* [BRD] The composer on Crescent Island will teach you Sinewy Etude once you've played seven pianos and Hero's Rime once you've played all eight.
* The Accessory Shop sells Hermes Sandals for 50k each. They give permanent Haste (and thus immunity to Slow, Stop, Paralyze, and Sleep) and are easily the best accessory in the game.
* There's a free pair late in the Rift... but still buy all 4 now, rather than waiting, if you can afford them. Sell all your garbage to do so.
* Don't forget the Thief Knife behind the bar, which gives every party access to !Steal.
* [MIM] For some reason, Mimes can wear the Thief Gloves from World 1 to boost the success rate of the Thief Knife !Mug proc.
* [SUM] In Faris's old hideout, you can get the Syldra summon. When boosted with the Air Knife, it's the strongest summon in the game.
* [SUM] You can also visit Bal Castle's basement to get the Odin summon, but it's not that useful. It doesn't work like Lamp Odin does on the final boss.
* [SUM+CHM] The Elemental Power mix actually does boost Water, so Leviathan will beat Syldra in raw power, but you have Chemist, so whatever.
* [BLU] Blue Mages can (and should!) learn Mighty Guard from Stingrays, a rare encounter in the water south of the huge desert.
* [BLU] You'll have to Confuse it with !White/!Mix/!Sing/!Control/!Dance/the Dancing Dagger.
* [BST] The Stingray, a rare encounter in the water south of the huge desert, drops the Dragon Whisker, the strongest whip in the game.
* [BST] Of course, it's a rare encounter and a rare drop, so you may want to skip it.
* [BST] If you're interested, the easiest kill is to !Release a Zombie Dragon to poison it, then hold it down with !Control and watch it slowly bleed out. You monster.
* [BLU|BST] GBA players (NA version only) can use the Quicksave trick to find guaranteed Stingrays.
* [DNC] Dancers (and Equip Ribbon-havers) will appreciate the Ribbon that the girl in the middle of the Regole equipment shop gives you.
* [DNC] Stop by Phoenix Tower to common-steal a Rainbow Dress from Parthenope (with the Thief's Knife, obviously) so that you can Swords Dance half the time you !Dance.
* [DNC] The Dress means you you don't care about Lamia's Tiara or Red Slippers, which is good because Ribbons and Hermes Sandals are strictly better in those slots.
* [FRE] Freelancers will appreciate the Ribbon that the girl in the Regole equipment shop gives you.
* [FRE] You can also wear the Thief Gloves from World 1 to boost the success rate of the Thief Knife !Mug proc.
* [RDM] While RDM can't summon Phoenix, everything in Phoenix Tower is vulnerable to Toad, and the Magic Pots alone give enough AP to get halfway to !Dualcast.
* [RDM] There's nowhere better if you're specifically planning to grind for !Dualcast. Which you might not want to for your sanity's sake.

## Island Shrine
* Consider carefully whether you actually need to do the various optional World 3 dungeons. Most parties don't!
* The Island Shrine is required for Fork Tower, therefore also the Deep Sea Trench and Istory Falls.
* [CAN|GLD|ORC] And yes, this means it's mandatory to unlock Cannoneer, Gladiator, and Oracle. Sorry.
* [THF] The Island Shrine contains the Rising Sun, the best Thief-only weapon in the game (but you probably don't care.)
* [THF] Additional Mirage Vests, which grant natural Blink, can be rarely stolen from Oiseaurares in the Shrine as well.
* [THF] You can steal more Ice Shields from Numb Blades here, if you have a use for them. Stokker in here may be one.
* [BST] If you're coming here for other reasons anyway, the Beast Killer whip can do a lot in a few fights later.

## Stokker
* 20000 HP, uses physical attacks and Hurricane/Mind Blast/Confuse.
* Attacking the 'wrong' ones of the four does no damage. The real one always starts in the top right for the first hit, then moves to a random location when hit.
* They respond to multi-target attacks with an Ice-element counter.
* If you have Fire Rings or Ice Shields, you can just blast away to your heart's content.
* [WHM] You can just Shell up and heal through the counterattacks.
* [BLU] With Mighty Guard and White Wind, you don't really care about the counterattacks.
* [BLU] You can learn Mind Blast while you're here, even though you'll never use it.
* [BLU] You can inflict Sleep with Time Slip on Pixel, but not in other versions thanks to the Old immunity.
* [RDM|BLM|MYS] Just put it to Sleep. If it's asleep, it can't move or counter.
* [TIM] You can hit it with Slow.
* [RAN] !Rapid Fire isn't technically multi-target. You're good, no counters here.
* [BER] Unlike most things that counter indiscriminate attacks, since Berserker isn't multi-target, it's not actively detrimental here. Yay Berserker!
* [BST] This fight isn't great for !Release. A Dragon Aevis from the Void will do 5000 damage, but provoke counters.
* [BST] Four of them will still kill, you'll just eat a lot of counters along the way.
* Attacking the real one with a weak weapon (like unarmed fists or a Knife) will display 0 damage and still doesn't trigger a move.
* You can then unleash your strongest attack on that one, let it move, and repeat the process.

## Fork Tower
* Think about whether you actually need to do the various optional World 3 dungeons. Many parties don't.
* If you don't need specific loot from Fork Tower, the Deep Sea Trench, or Istory Falls, and you don't have to unlock Cannoneer, Gladiator, or Oracle, you should just go to the Rift now.
* Magic users go to the LEFT and physical fighters go to the RIGHT.
* Many rod-using parties can take good advantage of the Wonder Wand in Fork Tower, especially if they lack !White.
* It cycles through all the !White and !Black spells in a set order.
* This gives rod-users guaranteed access to Berserk, as well as Death, Reflect, Protect, Shell, and others.
* [WHM] Fork Tower is the only way to learn Holy, which gives White Mages (fantastic) offense.
* [BLM] Fork Tower is the only way to learn Flare for Black Mages... and honestly, that's not enough of a reason to bother on its own.
* [MYS] Fork Tower is the only way to learn Flare for Flare !Spellblade, which is far better than the spell itself. You should do it.
* [TIM] Meteor is locked behind Fork Tower. Make it happen.
* [KGT|FRE] The Defender is in Fork Tower (it casts Protect on use, and has a 1/3 physical attack block rate) but that's not enough to go there on its own.
* [CAN|GLD|ORC] In case the above didn't make it obvious, your Advance job is locked behind Fork Tower, so it's mandatory for you.
* [MIM] Mime is locked behind Fork Tower, it's mandatory for you.

## Minotaur & Omniscient
* Minotaur is easy even for mages. Chicken Knife and potions will get you there in the end.
* Don't be afraid to back off on DPS, since Minotaur counters with more physical attacks but doesn't do anything nasty if you stop to heal.
* Minotaur absorbs Holy, so don't attack with the Excalibur or the Holy Lance.
* Don't enter the pause menu between Minotaur and Omniscient, because you WILL get a game over and you WILL feel stupid. I've done it. Multiple times.
* Omniscient casts Reset if hit with any command that he does not count as magic. Specifically, you can use !White, !Black, !Time, !Blue, !Summon, or !Dualcast. Being Silenced or Berserked prevents this.
* Omniscient's entire offense is neutralized by Reflect Rings, but you still need a way to deal damage.
* [WHM] White Mages can Berserk Omniscient, then spam Blink and trade attacks.
* [WHM] The Blink part is important. Omniscient is evidently very muscular under that rug.
* [GEO] http://i.imgur.com/JkwTg5O.png
* [CHM] Offensive !Mixes do cause Omniscient to reset the battle.
* [CHM] That said, you can just inflict Berserk (+Haste) first, then Blind, then !Mix to your heart's content.
* [BLM|SUM|TIM|RDM] With literally any job that has real damage spells, you can just damage race and heal up with items if needed.
* [MYS] Silence !Spellblade is hilariously effective.
* The Power Staff proc will Berserk Omniscient. Just prepare for a brutal slugfest.
* SNAPPING RODS COUNTS AS A PHYSICAL ATTACK (somehow...)
* ...except in the Matrix version, where !Item is not forbidden, giving you a nice strategy here.
* [BST] You can !Release a Mammon and have it target a Reflected party member to bounce Berserk onto Omniscient.
* [BST] It's not great, but it works. Shame you can't get Mammons outside of the Rift Castle, so it's quite a hike.
* [BST] Theoretically, you can also attack with the Whip, get the paralyze proc, and have 30 ticks to take other offensive actions. This is a way worse strategy and also doesn't work on Matrix.
* [DNC] For some unknown reason, !Dance doesn't get countered with Return. Even if it's Swords Dance to the facehole. Have fun.
* The Magic Lamp is used via !Item, so it provokes Return as well, so you can't do anything fancy with it. (Unless you're on Matrix.)
* Failing any other way to do this, there are three general strategies:
* 1) With a Reflect Ring+Mage Masher, reflect a Silence proc onto Omniscient by attacking yourself, then quickly attack before it wears off.
* 2) With a Reflect Ring+Bone Mail, just wait for Omniscient to commit suicide. Drain does a lot of the heavy lifting here.
* 3) With a Reflect Ring, wait out all 30,000 MP. This may happen before suicide from the second strategy does.
* 3.1) If you are going to do this, on GBA and SNES you can Reflect a Mage Masher proc and use an Ether on Omniscient. This overflows the 30,000 MP down to 9,999.
* All of these options suck and if they are your best options, you probably don't need to do Fork Tower.
* ...unless you need to unlock Oracle, Gladiator, or Cannoneer, in which case, you have my sympathies.

## Deep Sea Trench
* It's pretty rare for any Fiesta party to care about the Deep Sea Trench. Consider skipping it.
* [ORC|CAN|GLD] It's also required to unlock Oracle, Cannoneer, and Gladiator.
* [BRD] Bard parties might appreciate the Trench solely for the novelty of vaporizing its 100% undead inhabitants with Requiem.
* [BRD] Not a bad way to grind out XP/AP/gil, but with Bard you don't need that much grinding.
* [MNK] Monks can get the Kaiser Knuckles here, which turns their damage from pathetic to pretty bad.
* [MNK] It also competes for the accessory slot with Hermes Sandals, making it useless.
* [TIM] Meteor is locked behind the Deep Sea Trench, which makes it worth doing for Time Mages.

## Three Stooges
* 13333 HP each, primarily attack with not super dangerous black magic.
* The only real reason to fight these guys is if you have a Time Mage, for Meteor.
* They're Undead and not Heavy, so you can one-shot them with Phoenix Downs...
* ...but they'll revive each other, so you need to either stun then or use target-all.
* The easiest way to do this is to summon Odin from the Magic Lamp for a triple kill.
* Remember that you can recharge the Magic Lamp in the spring three screens back from here before leaving.
* [BRD] The Bard's Requiem song is, as you might expect, completely disgusting here.
* [WHM] Don't forget that White Mages can spam target-all Curagas on them.
* [WHM] Or hit each one exactly once with a single-target Curaga, then finish them all of at once or something.
* [BER] If you're going to fight it out, kill your Berserker as per usual for timing-sensitive fights.
* [BLM] Be careful with group-cast black magic, because each stooge absorbs the element it casts. Just Lamp.
* [MYS] If you can get three off in one round, Break Blade is an instant kill. But Lamp's likely easier.
* [BST] There isn't a !Catch faster than the Magic Lamp, so just use that.

## Istory Falls
* Istory Falls isn't useless per se. There's a lot of good loot in here, but it rarely makes or breaks a run.
* [CAN|GLD|ORC] It is, however, mandatory to unlock Cannoneer, Gladiator, and Oracle.
* [SUM] Summoners learn Leviathan here which is... completely useless due to the lack of water-boosting weapons.
* [SUM+CHM] ...unless you have Chemist, whose Elemental Power mix can boost Water spells. EP Leviathan is the second strongest spell and strongest AoE in the game.
* [BLU|RDM] The Enhancer available in Istory Falls boosts Magic for the Blue and Red Mages that can equip it.
* [MYS] The Enhancer available in Istory Falls is the best Spellblade-compatible weapon that's not the Chicken Knife.
* [MYS] That said, A) you probably will be using the Chicken Knife, and B) you can also get Enhancers in the Rift Castle via rare steal with the Thief Knife.
* [RAN] Rangers can get the Artemis Bow here, which is still worse than !Rapid Fire with the Chicken Knife.
* [RAN] That said, if you've got a second !Rapid Fire user taking up your Chicken Knife, it's probably the best option.
* [RAN] Notably, it does bonus damage against Magic Beasts, including the Almagest piece of the final boss.
* The Aegis Shield here is the real reason to run Istory. Having two Aegis Shields is huge if you have two Shield wearers.

## Leviathan
* Why are you here? There are easier Reflect Rings, and you don't need the actual summon.
* It's not even better than Syldra, unless you have a Chemist to mix Elemental Power.
* ...but then you'd have a Chemist, anyway.
* If you insist on fighting this out, bring Coral Rings rather than Hermes Sandals to weather the counterattacks.

## Interdimensional Rift
* The various zones in the Interdimensional Rift are primarily just filler.
* I'm trying to think of anything interesting to say about these zones or the trash in it.
* [GEO|FRE] You may want to pick up a rare drop Rune Chime from the Baldanders in the Ruins area. It boosts every element! Sometimes slightly useful, even if Air Knife is often just functionally equivalent.
* Three things.
* Get the Coral/Angel Rings in the Caves.
* Get the Ribbon in the Forest, and, uh...
* ...what's the third one there? uh, not the EPA.
* I can't. The third one, I can't. Sorry. Oops.

## Calofisteri
* Wait, it's the Department of Energy!
* Man, that was a lot funnier in 2015. --me, 2017
* Bone Mail + Hermes Sandals literally make a character immune to Calofisteri's entire moveset.
* Just hold down the Fight button and go make a sandwich.
* Left to her own devices, she will spam Reflect and then start bouncing debuffs and buffs off them.
* If anyone in your party is wearing a Reflect Ring, she'll never actually harm you outside of a Drain counter.

## Omega
* Optional superboss! No reason other than bragging rights (and a shiny circle on your Fiesta page) to try this.
* To pull this off at a sane level, you need both a way to neuter its offense and a way to actually deal damage.
* Without cheese but with good sandbagging classes like WHM or BLU, you can try to fight it out normally...
* ...but many parties don't even have a way to damage Omega through its 190 defense, 150 magic defense, Reflect, Shell, 7 elemental absorbs, 95% physical evasion, and 90% magic evasion.
* [BRD] Omega is vulnerable to being stopped by Romeo's Ballad.
* [BRD] On SNES and GBA, two hasted Bards can keep a full lock going while a third sings your speed up to 99.
* [BRD] After maximizing speed, one Bard can keep lockdown going while the other two sing Hero's Rime and your stat buff song of choice.
* [BRD] Then attack without fear of counterattacks.
* [BST] On GBA, Omega is vulnerable to being stopped by !Calm.
* [BST] Three hasted Beastmasters can keep a full lock going while your fourth party member attacks without fear of counterattacks.
* [BST] Beastmasters can release Yellow Dragons for 9999 each.
* [TIM] Time Mages can use the 'quickleak' technique (Quick+use Venom Rod+sit there with second action prompt up) to kill Omega very, very slowly.
* [TIM] Since this takes a few real-life hours, you may not want to attempt this on an actual physical SNES/GBA/iDevice.
* [TIM] Meteor and Comet deal unaspected damage and ignore reflects.
* [TIM] ...Unless they roll fantastically high, however, they'll get completely nullified by Omega's sky-high Magic Defense.
* [TIM] Quickleaking is really it for Time Mage without other class friends.
* [CHM] Chemists can pretty much make themselves invulnerable to every single one of Omega's attacks.
* [CHM] That's not literally true. You can still die to two Wave Cannons in a row without getting a turn to heal in between. But only that.
* [CHM] See, for example, sullla's solo Chemist log at http://www.sullla.com/FF/omegashinryuu.html
* [CHM] Hint: !Mixing five Turtle Soups decreases Omega's defense and magic defense to 1.
* Piercing defense is a start - criticals and axes are okay starting ideas if there's no better plan.
* [BLM] Black Mages can reflect a Thundaga off allies to bypass Omega's innate Reflect.
* [BLM] On SNES and GBA, reflecting off 3 allies and hitting the fourth (ideally someone with Diamond Armor access to weaken the blow) won't trigger Omega's brutal counters.
* [BLU] Blue Mages can chip Omega down with Thousand Needles.
* [BLU] This is awful, but with Mighty Guard and White Wind to keep yourself in the fight it's technically doable.
* [MYS] Thundaga Sword will do a lot of damage to Omega. 4x attack, ignores the insane defense, and... still misses a lot if you don't have a way to guarantee hitting.
* [RAN] While !Rapid Fire ignores defense and never misses, it also provokes TWO counterattacks.
* [DRG] Dragoons can chip away with the Trident, a spear that does lightning damage.
* [DRG] Even with !Jump, this will take ages. Consider not doing it.
* [SUM] Summoners can penetrate Omega's defenses with either Ramuh or Odin.
* [SUM] Odin will deal more damage unless you can Dispel the auto-Shell on Omega.
* [KGT|RDM|GLD] Anyone who can use a sword can... technically damage Omega with the Coral Sword.
* [KGT|RDM|GLD] And no, even a Gladiator doesn't want to. The Trident has exactly one more point of attack and is also lightning elemental. Still not worth it without !Jump.
* [GLD] Since there's no character with a Lightning-elemental !Finisher, there's no actually good option for GLD to damage Omega.
* [CAN] You can inflict Slow on Omega with the awesome power of your cannon. (You eat a counterattack for this. It's worth it.)
* [CAN] ...also, Vulner Cannon and Chaos Cannon don't provoke counterattacks, so you have a good damage option too.

## Apanda
* 22200 HP, Byblos 2.0, counterattack routines and all.
* You have a few more options available to you now, though...
* Apanda's fire weakness makes this fight easy.
* Apanda is vulnerable to Berserk from the Power Staff.
* [WHM] ...so White Mages can use the typical Berserk plus Blink combo.
* [SUM] Casting Ifrit makes Apanda waste a turn, during which its counterattacks are disabled.
* [SUM] ...and it's infinitely repeatable. This fight is completely free for you.
* [BST] !Releasing a Great Dragon from the Caves just before this fight will do 9999 to one target.
* [BST] This tip is valid for the rest of the game... and you'll be seeing it a lot.
* [TIM] Apanda is vulnerable to Slow.
* [RAN|FRE] Apanda is vulnerable to Blind from the Dark Bow, if it survives long enough for it to matter.
* [BLU] Apanda is also vulnerable to Blind.
* [CAN] Apanda is vulnerable to Berserk, Slow, and Blind from your Cannons.

## Dimension Castle
* If you have strong AoE, the 2x Sword Dancer + 2x Death Claw encounter in the lobby is easy experience and ABP.
* You can grab a Hermes Sandals from a treasure chest in the Castle, but you should already have your full 4, because gil is best used for shoes.
* [DNC] If you still need Red Shoes or Rainbow Dresses, there's one of each in the downstairs cells if you fight the Jura Aevises.
* [DNC] And don't forget the Man-Eater, because it's better than everything a Dancer can wield that isn't the Chicken Knife.
* [MNK+DNC] Somehow, because you have both Monk and Dancer, you can give the Monk a real weapon, since Equip Ribbons gives Man-Eater access and it's great.
* Iron Giants are common in random encounters here. They're worth 10k experience each but are relatively tough.
* They only use physical attacks, but hit hard. They're vulnerable to Death and Petrify.

## Azulmagia
* 27900 HP, casts only !Blue spells.
* Go in with an odd level not divisible by 5 (don't worry about L3 Flare) to neuter the Level X spells.
* Technically optional, since the fight reward is a save point.
* Azulmagia is weak to poison, so you can just snap a ton of Poison Rods and call it a day.
* The Wonder Wand will also let you cast a single Reflect, which does good work against Mighty Guard (including giving you a bonus Float before Catastrophe).
* [MYS] Azulmagia is weak to poison, so Bio !Spellblade is the way to go.
* [BLU] Your Blue Mage can actually 'teach' Azulmagia new !Blue spells, which will then get tested on you.
* [BLU] You can teach Self-Destruct to end the fight in one round.
* [BLU] But first, check whether you want to learn anything here.
* [BLU] If your party is divisible by level 3, you have Reflect Rings, and you want an even funnier kill, try teaching Level 3 Flare.
* [BST] Great Dragon still does 9999 per !Release here.
* [WHM] You can Reflect Azulmagia even without the Wonder Wand. This gives you Float from a Wonder Guard cast if you don't want to muck around with Confuse before Catastrophe.

## Catastrophe
* 19997 HP, casts 100 Gs to dispel Float, then spams Earth Shaker and occasionally petrifies a target.
* 100 Gs can be reflected. Floating character + Reflect Ring means Catastrophe will literally never attack.
* Dancing Dagger to confuse a Gaelicat (North Mountain) or Poison Eagle (rare encounter in the first room of the Cave [before Omega], feed it an Ether) for Float.
* Just don't use a Cottage or touch a healing pot (like the Phantom Village void one) once you're Floating.
* [TIM] ...or just cast the Float spell with your Time Mage.
* [TIM] While you're at it, you can Slow if you want to make the fight go slightly faster.
* [CHM] ...or just use the Levisalve !Mix with your Chemist.
* [BLU] ...or just use Mighty Guard, which gives Float.
* [BLU] I guess you could also cast Flash for novelty? Don't bother.
* Of course, many parties have the HP/healing/offense to power through Earth Shakers and kill Catastrophe normally.
* Try it out before bothering with Float cheese if you want to potentially save time.
* [BST] For instance, !Releasing two Great Dragons will kill Catastrophe. Because they do 9999.
* [CAN] Catastrophe is vulnerable to Slow and Old if you're going to just power through.

## Halicarnassus
* 33333 HP, sky-high level (affects ailment spell accuracy).
* Starts the fight by casting Ribbit to turn the entire party into frogs.
* Casts Holy once every eight turns; having the party Reflected will let you scam an easy kill.
* In general, only has single-target offense. Any party can sandbag with Phoenix Downs.
* [SUM] For whatever reason, Halicarnassus counters all offensive summons with a single-target Strong Fight for 9999 that hits through Golem.
* [SUM] You can still just spam Carbuncle until it impales itself with Holy, though. Or use a lot of Phoenix Downs.
* [BLM|RDM] The opening Ribbit spell just toggles Frog, so come into the fight as frogs to be cured by Ribbit and waste that turn.
* [BLU] Halicarnassus is vulnerable to Blind if you want to mess around with trying to land Flash. I wouldn't bother, personally.
* [BLU] Also, the double Old and Slow vulnerability means that, for once, Time Slip actually works in this fight. That one's worth it, maybe.
* [MYS] Halicarnassus is vulnerable to Silence, which prevents the occasional self-buff and also Holy.
* [MYS] That said, since Silence doesn't last that long on Heavy targets, run the numbers on just Flare Sword beatdown instead.
* [FRE|DNC] Halicarnassus is a human, so you can break out the shiny new Man-Eater from the room to the left immediately before this fight for lots of damage.
* [BST] You don't have a better !Release option than Great Dragons, again, but 4*9999 > 33333 so it's no big deal.
* [TIM] Halicarnassus is vulnerable to Old and Slow. Sky-high magic evasion means Meteor spam is probably just better, though.
* [WHM] Halicarnassus is vulnerable to Mini and Silence, but you'll have a hard time landing them.
* [WHM] Instead, take advantage of all the attacks being single-target and spam Raise.
* [CHM] You can set Darkness on Halicarnassus easily, since Dark Sigh doesn't care about magic evasion or the target's level.
* [CHM] ...except on the Matrix version, where Dark Sigh got 'fixed' to be blockable. You've been warned.
* [CAN] Halicarnassus is vulnerable to Mini, Old, Darkness, and Slow, all of which your Cannons can set.
* [CAN] Mini's only benefit is doubling evade, and Halicarnassus naturally has 0, and 2*0=0, so...

## Twintania
* There was an extended FF14 joke here, but then Stormblood got an entire FFV themed raid tier and it started to feel dated.
* When charging Giga Flare, Twintania stops being Heavy and has zero status resistance. You have the Assassin's Dagger.
* Just turtle up to avoid its counterattacks and get the Dagger proc to instantly kill the charging form.
* If you're having trouble surviving, you can equip a Coral Ring and physically attack to heal for free off the counterattack.
* The Wonder Wand from Fork Tower can be cycled through to casting Death before the fight... but you can also just use the Assassin's Dagger.
* [MYS] Holy Blade and Break Blade both work on the charging form.
* [SUM] Catoblepas and Odin both work on the charging form.
* [TIM] Banish and Stop both work on the charging form.
* [CHM] Death Potion works on the charging form.
* [BST] An Executor from the Solitary Island Shrine casts Level 5 Death on !Release, which works on the charging form.
* [BST] If you didn't pick one up earlier, using the Assassin's Dagger will be faster than walking out for one.
* [BLU] Level 5 Death works on the charging form.
* [DNC] !Flirt can lock down the charging form, so you have infinite tries to get the Assassin's Dagger to stick.
* [THF] Each form has separate steals. The first form has a rare Flame Shield, and the charging form has a common [second] Titan's Axe.
* [THF+BER] Despite having a Berserker, you STILL probably don't care about the second Titan's Axe.
* [THF+BER] Though it's your first if you didn't do Istory Falls, so if you have 2+ Bersekers (first one wants Rune Axe) and couldn't do Fork Tower, here's your chance.
* [SAM] If for some reason you still need it, the charging form can rarely drop a Murasame when killed.
* [SAM] !Iainuki works on the charging form.
* [RAN|FRE] Killer Bow works on the charging form.
* [CAN] Chaos Cannon works on the charging form.
* [RDM] You can put Reflect Rings on everyone, then !Dualcast any offensive spell on the first form to bait out reflectable Mega Flare counters.
* [RDM] ...Or just use the Assassin's Dagger on the charging form like everyone else.
* [WHM] While White Mages can't wield the Assassin's Dagger, the non-charging form is weak to Holy and Reflect bounces the Mega Flare counters.
* [WHM] If you have nothing but White Mages, Monks and Oracles, break out the Coral Rings to survive Tidal Wave counters. Otherwise, the Dagger works.
* [MNK] Boy, I hope you don't have four of these, because they're literally useless without someone else's skills here.
* [MNK] If you have nothing but White Mages, Monks and Oracles, break out the Coral Rings to survive Tidal Wave counters. Otherwise, the Dagger works.
* [ORC] Oracle can't wield the Assassin's Dagger.
* [ORC] If you have nothing but White Mages, Monks and Oracles, break out the Coral Rings to survive Tidal Wave counters.

## The Void
* Most groups will simply want to blast through the Void on the way to NED.
* The last Gilgamesh fight is basically just a victory lap. He has 7000 effective HP and only uses unimpressive physical attacks.
* He has a Genji Shield to steal/Thief Knife, but Aegis Shields are better.
* The vast majority of trash encounters in the Void are brutal; most groups should just run.
* XP/ABP/gil are generally easier to get back in the first room of the Castle.
* [THF] Crystal Dragons have Elixirs as their common steal if you want to stock up.
* [THF] You probably don't need more, but Bone Mails can be stolen from Necromancers.
* The random encounter with 3 Movers is 199 AP per fight, but you have to win before they run away.
* They're a rare encounter in the room with Necrophobe, so GBA players can Quicksave, reload, and see them as the second encounter every time.
* They're Heavy, Undead, and vulnerable to Fire.
* [SUM] If you actually bothered to get Phoenix for your Summoner, now's a good chance to just explode them all.
* [SUM] If not, Ifrit is probably still enough when backed with Hermes Sandals-level speed.
* [BLM|MYS] Firaga/Firaga Sword will make quick work of them.
* [BST] Beastmasters can !Control them and force them to suicide.
* [TIM] Time Mages can land Slowga on the Movers and just win by burning them down.
* [BRD] Bards can vaporize the Movers easily with Requiem, since they're Undead.
* [RDM] When Confused, Movers cast Transfusion and kill themselves. You have Confuse and you might want to grind !Dualcast. This is the perfect spot.
* [WHM] When Confused, Movers cast Transfusion and kill themselves.

## Shinryu
* Optional superboss! There is no reason other than bragging rights (and a nice heart on your fiesta page) to try this.
* Generally a lot more possible than Omega. There's a lot of ways to hurt Shinryu, so the only real question is how not to die.
* Coral Rings to absorb the opening Tidal Wave is mandatory for a straight-up fight...
* ...unless you are using Berserk strategies, in which case literally every job can get one turn before Tidal Wave via Hermes Sandals.
* As such, the vast majority of easy Shinryu kills involve Berserk.
* [TIM] Obvious exception, Quick + Venom Rod works just as well here as anywhere, if you have the patience.
* [WHM] Anyone with !White can simply cast Berserk, of course.
* Anyone who can wield a Rod can (eventually) cast Berserk with the Wonder Wand.
* Staff-users can attack with the Power Staff to apply a Berserk proc.
* [CHM] Chemists can mix Holy Water + Turtle Shell for a guaranteed Berserk.
* [BST] If you don't have better Berserk options, bring at least one party member with a Reflect Ring.
* [BST] !Release a Mammon (caught in the Rift Castle) to cast Berserk and hope it targets the Reflected party member to bounce it to Shinryu.
* [BST] Once you've gotten that RNG, !Release a Galajelly from the same encounter to blind Shinryu and trivialize the fight.
* [BST] Also, you can !Calm lock on GBA, if you really want to. You don't need to, though, because blind is very strong.
* [BST] Also, if you want a Dragon Whisker for your Beastmaster, remember that you can run from Shinryu.
* [BST] There's nothing stopping you from !Stealing (or Thief Knife !Mugging) and running repeatedly. Except common sense, really.
* You also need some way of surviving incredibly fast one-shot physical attacks.
* The Aegis Shield + mini status will boost a character's evasion % into the stratosphere.
* So will the Genji Shield from Gilgamesh in the Void, if you stole it. 99% Shield Evasion, baby!
* [WHM] White Mages have access to Blink as well, making them perfect for this strategy.
* [KGT] Knights can coverscum Shinryu the same way they can any other berserked enemy.
* [FRE|KGT] Shinryu absorbs Holy, so don't hit it with the Excalibur.
* [SUM] Summoners can barely keep up with Shinryu's offense by casting Golem before every hit.
* [NIN] If you give the Ninja's !Image command to everyone, that'll work just fine.
* [CHM] Chemists can also inflict Blind with Dragon Fang + Eye Drops.
* [RAN] Rangers can inflict blind at a flat 66% rate with Dark Bow !Attacks, since it doesn't care about level or magic evasion.
* [CAN] You can inflict both Berserk and Blind with your magic gun.
* [CAN] Admittedly, you're using up one of the 4 Ash in the game to do so. Maybe take a picture for RK but don't save afterwards.
* [CAN] Kidding. There's no better use for Ash than this!
* In the worst case scenario, any class which can wear the Mirage Vest can abuse a GBA bug.
* On GBA, changing weapons with a Mirage Vest equipped will refresh its start-of-battle Blink status.
* In the ACTUAL worst case scenario, if you bring enough Phoenix Downs, you don't really need to survive the punches.
* All Staff users have the Sage's Staff to help mitigate Phoenix Down usage, even without actual Raise access.
* [BRD] Even without any Berserk access, you can get a !Hide off before the first Tidal Wave and have a Zombie party member with a Reflect Ring eventually Reflect Shinryu's Atomic Rays for the full 55,500 HP.
* [BRD] The only way to speed this up is to bring more than one Zombie, as there's no weapon that brings a reflectable proc and NOT access to a better method of killing.
* [BRD] Alternatively, if you have Berserk access, use Apollo's Harp to kill really, really quickly. 8x damage is stupid.

## Necrophobe
* Necrophobe is an optional fight! The only reward is the last save point before NED, which is good, but still optional.
* The first phase is four 8800 HP auto-reflect Barriers, which alternate between Firaga/Blizzaga/Thundaga and Holy/Flare.
* The second phase is Necrophobe himself, with 34044 effective HP, weak to all elements, spams double physical attacks/Vacuum Waves.
* He'll have 44044 HP if you didn't get Excalipoor, but why would you leave Gilgamesh all alone?
* Reflect Rings let you bounce spells off yourself to penetrate the Barriers' Reflect status.
* Similarly, it might be tempting to try and Assassin's Dagger the Barriers. Don't do it, because that Doom proc gets reflected.
* [SAM] Samurai can just !Zeninage the Barriers down at a high enough level.
* [SAM] You might think to use !Iainuki, but the Barriers are heavy, so it won't work.
* [SUM] Air Knife boosted Syldra can easily DPS race the Barriers.
* [SUM] If you want variety in your life, you can use Catoblepas to petrify them instead.
* [SUM] Golem almost completely neuters Necrophobe's offense.
* [TIM] Remember that Comet and Meteor ignore Reflect. It'll take extra Meteors, since Necrophobe is effectively a blank target, but you'll get there.
* [BST] Beastmasters can (still) !Release Great Dragons from the Caves to hit a random target for 9999, which will kill a Barrier.
* [BST] Just pray that the random target selection doesn't pick Necrophobe.
* [RAN] !Rapid Fire to fish for Killer Bow procs works fairly well, though you will inevitably 'waste' some hits on Necrophobe.
* [RAN] Alternatively, !Rapid Fire with the Chicken Knife, since the Barriers aren't THAT beefy.
* [FRE] The Killer Bow's death proc doesn't reflect, so that's one option for the Barriers.
* [FRE] Don't try Death Sickles. Their Doom proc gets Reflected.
* [BER] Don't try Death Sickles. Their Doom proc gets Reflected.
* [MYS] Break Blade works on the Barriers.
* [MYS] Necrophobe is weak to every element, so pick your favorite !Spellblade.
* [BLM] Bouncing Break or Death off your own Reflect Ringed party member is a workable, if randomly targeted, way to kill the Barriers.
* [BLM] Necrophobe is weak to every element, so any of the boosted -aga spells will surpass Flare.
* [CHM] Death Potion kills Barriers.
* [CHM] Necrophobe's weakness to every element means you can Holy Breath for large amounts.
* [BLU] The Barriers are level 44, so it takes three Dark Sparks to hit them with Level 5 Death.
* [BLU] They're also heavy, so Death Claw won't work.
* [BLU] Thanks to Reflect, your best multi-target option here is Aqua Breath.
* [BRD] The Barriers only have 300 MP, so !Hide stalling (if you're not on Pixel) can run them out quickly and give you infinite singing time afterwards.
* [BRD] Be sure to leave someone not singing, because they don't have physical attacks to break you out of song.
* [THF] Don't forget the Genji Armor from Gilgamesh. It's a present from him to you!
* [CAN] Chaos Cannon kills Barriers.
* [CAN] Necrophobe is vulnerable to Slow and Darkness, both of which you have Cannons for.
* [GLD] One successful !Finisher kills a Barrier. You also have !Bladeblitz to plink them all down at once.

## Tree Exdeath
* 49001 HP. Starts with regular attacks and White Hole (inflicts both petrify and death, blocked by immunity to either).
* Adds Holy and Condemn below 30000, then Meteo below 10000. Rush that last 10K HP, Meteo hurts.
* Spawns Neo-Exdeath on death. Don't do anything to break that script, like Kiss of Blessing, Counter, or Vulner Cannon.
* [BRD] This fight continues into NED, so Bards can use the time to go capped-stats Super Saiyan now.
* [BRD] White Hole can put a wrench in that plan - if you have the time to kill, you can !Hide until Exdeath runs out of MP.
* [BRD] Also worth noting that for some reason, EXDEATH'S PHYSICAL ATTACKS DO NOT BREAK !SING on SNES and GBA (but do properly on Matrix.)
* [BRD] So don't put all four party members into songs, and likely not even three because an unlucky White Hole or physical will effectively wipe you.
* [TIM] For some reason, the tree is not immune to Slow. Enjoy.
* [CHM] Yes, yes, on SNES you can use Kiss of Blessing to stop NED from spawning and thus skip the final boss. Gold star. Don't.
* [CHM] This fight continues into NED, so Chemists can use the time to go immune-to-everything-level-255 Super Saiyan now.
* Aegis Shield blocks White Hole completely, so have it on your most indispensible character.
* [WHM] This fight continues into NED, so Shell and Protect on the party will carry over.
* [DNC] Don't be fooled by it being a tree, it's actually a Human. Feel free to Eat the Man.
* [BLU] Mighty Guard. Mightguardmightyguardmightyguard. You can even facetank Meteor with it. And it carries over into NED.
* [BLU] ...Especially after you land Dark Spark once into Level 2 Old.
* [BLU] You also have Magic Hammer access to drain MP before pushing to Meteor phase (and stop White Holes too) - but this is likely too cute, just kill it.
* [NIN] Now is probably be a good time to !Throw all those legendary weapons, if you're having trouble burning the last 10k HP.
* [CAN] Don't do anything cute. Anything that bypasses counters will skip NED's spawn just like the Kiss of Blessing glitch.
* [CAN] However, you can inflict Slow just fine, since for some reason this first part of the literal final boss is not immune to Slow.
* [MNK] Killing with a !Counter will skip NED, which... honestly, is impressive, given that under 10k HP you should only be seeing Meteors.
* [MNK] I'm pretty sure you can only get that Counter kill with a Berserk that would be breaking NED anyway, but I felt like Monk deserved a little shoutout here.
* [BST] Hold your Dragon Aevises for NED.

## Neo Ex Cactuar

* Biggest threats are: Grand Cross (random ailments), Almagest (1620-1665 holy damage + Sap status), enrage (last part living uses every part's bad stuff, plus gets two attacks per turn.)
* Grand Cross can be mitigated with Hermes Sandals, Aegis Shield, and luck. Most parties will kill Grand Cross first to lower the number of dice rolls.
* Almagest is a HP check. Unless you have extreme damage output and rush it first, you will need the HP, or Shell, to survive it.
* You can skip enrage either by counting HP and killing the last 2 parts at the same time...
* ...or by saving the bottom left (non-Heavy) part for last, then killing it with Odin from the Magic Lamp.
* Even without !White, you get one free Shell cast from the Wonder Wand.
* [BER] In the SNES version, there are two 'dummy' targets in the fight that will cause your Berserker to miss a lot. You will probably be better served equipping the Earth Hammer and Thornlet to underflow your magic stat.
* [BER] In the GBA version, the dummy targets are gone, making the Rune Axe much more reliable.
* [BER] In the Matrix version, Berserkers attack targets in a nice orderly fashion, which is actually awful when trying to avoid enrage mode. Play around it.
* [MYS] Congratulations! Mystic Knights don't care about Almagest. Break Blade kills the part that casts it with 100% accuracy.
* [TIM] If things go seriously south, Quick is a good recovery tool to throw out two Phoenix Downs/Remedies/Elixirs in one turn.
* [TIM] On SNES, your Meteors will be weaker than expected, due to the presence of two 'dummy' targets.
* [TIM] If you're a gambling sort, you can try to land Old on the Almagest part at *extremely* low odds.
* [TIM] You can also, with even more gambling (and high levels) involved, attempt to Banish the far-left piece. Not very practical, but absolutely hilarious.
* [DRG] The Dragon Lance is super-effective against the Grand Cross part, if you're burning that one first.
* [DRG] Almagest is telegraphed by Neo Exdeath beginning to shake, and Grand Cross is telegraphed by the warning 'The laws of the universe mean nothing!'.
* [DRG] A well-timed !Jump can dodge each.
* [DNC] You'll probably have to look elsewhere for damage, but Equip Ribbons make Grand Cross almost completely useless.
* [DNC] That said, the Man-Eater deals critical damage to the left-most piece (the one that dies to Magic Lamp Odin, so this tip isn't great.)
* [CHM] Chemists want to lean on spamming Holy Breath (Dragon Fang + Holy Water). It does damage equal to your HP, which combos with Giant's Drink doubling your max HP.
* [CHM] Between Giant's Drink and the ability to Shell the team, Chemists can neuter Almagest.
* [CHM] Dragon's Kiss (Dragon Fang + Maiden's Kiss) also grants immunity from Grand Cross's 'HP Critical' result.
* [SAM] You will need an obscene amount of cash to kill NED with just !Zeninage, but it's conceptually simple.
* [SAM] If you have a way to kill them, the Movers in the last room of the void drop 50k gil each and come in packs of three.
* [THF] Remember that the weapons you can steal off of NED's parts (Ragnarok, Dragon Lance, Murakumo) can be equipped mid-battle.
* [THF+NIN] ...or thrown by your Ninja.
* [BST] Beastmasters can release a Dragon Aevis for a 9999-all-target Breath Wing. 4 of them will get NED's parts real low.
* [BST] You can also release a Crystelle for Mighty Guard to trivialize Almagest, but catching one's a horrible pain and literally impossible without the Kornago Gourd.
* [BST] As long as you're under level 45, using the Dancing Dagger in the back row against a Crystelle that you have !Controlled to use Protect on itself first can do the necessary 2 damage.
* [BST] Alternatively, if you have an Excalipoor wielder, that's going to be way easier.
* [BLU] Mighty Guard and White Wind allow you to win stand-up brawls against NED with little fuss.
* [BLU] Or you could abuse Dark Spark and L5 Death, but honestly it's not really worth the setup time and Dark Spark missing.
* [BLU+CHM] Unless you have !Mix AND math both on your side, which lets you set up the hilarious QUAD SKULL by taking all parts to level 255.
* [BLU] Condemn works on the far-left piece, if you don't want to just Magic Lamp it, or if you think that telling the final boss it has 30 seconds to live is hilarious (it is.)
* [BLU] The top-left piece, which casts Grand Cross, can be locked down by Paralyze from Mind Blast. That said, it has 75% magic evasion and is high level, so it's likely not worth the effort.
* [BRD] Apollo's Harp does 8x damage against the Grand Cross part, if for some reason your party isn't 99 speed/level 255 anyway.
* [BRD] ...but they should be, since you buffed all your stats to maximum in the Treedeath phase of the fight, right?
* [RAN] The Melee piece (the one that chucks out 1800 damage Vacuum Waves) can be blinded by Dark Bow.
* [RAN] On SNES, the two 'dummy' targets make !Rapid Fire less reliable.
* [SUM] An actual !Summoned Odin will not work on the leftmost part, as he will use Gungnir if any enemy on the field is Heavy.
* [SUM] Boosted Syldras can probably end this fight before it really begins. Load !Summon and Air Knives on everyone.
* [NIN] Scrolls are still good AoE if backed up by a magic ability.
* [NIN] Now is the time to throw the legendary weapons you aren't using for good single-target damage. Fuma Shurikens are stronger, though.
* [GEO] !Gaia will always use Wind Slash here. Boost it with Air Knife or Rune Chime, and it'll do reasonable AoE damage.
* [MNK] Unless you did a lot of grinding, your fists won't do much here. Just settle for a beefy Elixir dispenser, or use some other class's secondary.
* [MNK] HP +30% can help other classes survive Almagest, though, and an actual Monk almost always will.
* [WHM] Blink is good against the physicals/Vacuum Waves. Shell is great against Almagest. You know the drill.
* [SUM|BLM] If you're having trouble killing the Almagest piece before it kills you, you can attempt (at fairly low odds) to Petrify it.
* [SUM|BLM] At sane levels, you've got about an 8% shot per cast. It's low, but can save you a bunch of grinding in return for a bunch of RNG.
* [BLM] AoE damage makes it pretty easy to kill the last two parts at the same time.
* [BLM] If you go with this method, though, keep in mind that the far right piece has 5000 less HP than the middle pieces.
* [BLM] Alternatively, the far-left piece has 5000 more than the middle ones, and dies to Magic Lamp Odin, so you can leave it for last on purpose.
* [RDM] At least you can put up Protect...?
* [RDM] Raise+Cura isn't the *worst*, but you're probably better off breaking rods for middling damage.
* [RDM] Hopefully you have another class that can use !Dualcast and can pick up the slack.
* [KGT] Aegis Shield protects against a few Grand Cross outcomes, and can block Almagest, but you were wearing it anyway.
* [KGT] If you have the Defender from Fork Tower, you can use it to apply Protect to help mitigate Vacuum Wave, if you're worried.
* [KGT+THF] You can steal a Ragnarok in this fight, and then swap it in to wield it without having to fight Shinryu, but it's a rare steal so it may not be worth your time.
* [KGT+THF] ...and this is relevant because if you have Knight and Thief, your odds of being able to fight Shinryu are not great.
* [FRE] If all else fails, you have access to Apollo's Harp (top middle piece), Man-Eater (far left piece), and Artemis Bow (bottom middle piece) for 8x, 2x, and 2x !Attack damage respectively.
* [FRE] Wearing a Ribbon is great against Grand Cross, plus you have Aegis Shield access.
* [CAN] The physical attack piece (far right) and the magic piece (far left) are vulnerable to Slow.
* [CAN] All four pieces are vulnerable to Darkness, but only the far-right one actually matters, because that one physically attacks.
* [CAN] The Almagest piece (bottom middle) is vulnerable to Old, which will completely nerf its Almagest damage.
* [CAN] The Grand Cross piece (top middle) is a Dragon, so it will take double damage from Dragon Cannon, which might do more than Needle Cannon at sane levels.
* [CAN] Between the Lamp, Darkness+Slow, and Old, the only piece you don't outright neuter is the Grand Cross piece... and for some reason CAN gets Aegis Shield access.
* [GLD] Fishing for 9999 !Finisher probably averages more damage than !Bladeblitz, but either should be fine, because Gladiator has lots of weapon options and LOTS of Strength.
* [ORC] Uh... just do whatever you've been doing all game. Probably with your other three jobs, honestly.
