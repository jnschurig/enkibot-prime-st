    Kills the caster and deals damage equal to their current HP. Single-target.
  Note: >
    The only reason to pick this up is for an eventual Azulmagia fight. Use 
    it against Azulmagia and they will copy it, and use it right back on 
    you and you will win instantly. Don't do this if the party only has 2 
    living characters to start with.
