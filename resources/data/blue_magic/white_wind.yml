  Description: >
    Restores party HP equal to caster's current HP. Pierces Reflect. Multi-target.
  Note: >
    In the Pixel Remaster version of the game, Confuse will make monsters 
    incorrectly cast White Wind on the enemy team, rather than the player 
    team. In other versions this works correctly.
