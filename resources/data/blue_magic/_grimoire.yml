Notes:
  Learning: |
    To learn any !Blue magic, a monster or enemy must use the spell and it must
    successfully land against the learner. If the effects of the spell are blocked,
    dodged, reflected, or it misses, the spell will *not* be learned. After the spell
    hits the learner, the party must WIN the battle. If the battle ends in party wipeout
    or escape, the spell is not learned. A blue spell only need be learned by one
    character to be usable to the entire party. All characters whose job is set to Blue
    Mage inherently have *Learn*, even if it isn't explicitly equipped as an ability.
    Other jobs require having *Learn* set as an ability to be able to learn !Blue skills. 
  Advanced: |
    Some monsters can only teach their blue spell through the use of **!Control** from
    the Beastmaster class. Others still may ALSO require that a monster have Reflect cast
    on them so that the non-targetable spell can be reflected off a monster and land
    on a learner. Yet other monsters may only use their !Blue spell when under the
    influence of Confuse.
  Level "n" Spell: |
    The learner must have a level which is a multiple of n and be affected by the spell.
    In the case of Level 5 Death, the learner must have a level which is a multiple of 5,
    AND they must die to learn the spell. Be careful not to have all party members at the
    same level when attempting to learn this skill.
