  Note: >
    This spell can be learned from the Enchanted Fan that Metamorph 
    temporarily becomes. Metamorph can cycle through 3 distinct monsters 
    during each encounter. The desired "pack" is Ifrit, Wyvern, and 
    Enchanted Fan. This version of the encounter happens only in the 
    early rooms of Ghido's cave.
