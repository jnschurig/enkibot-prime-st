Notes:
- Learning: >
    To learn any !Blue magic, the spell must successfully land against the learner. 
    If the effects of the spell are blocked, dodged, reflected, or it misses, it 
    will not be learned. After the spell hits the learner, the party must WIN the 
    battle. If the battle ends in party wipeout or escape, the spell is not learned. 
    A blue spell only need be learned by one character to be used by the entire party.
- Advanced: >
    Some monsters can only teach their blue spell through the use of !Control from 
    the Beastmaster class. Others still may ALSO require that a monster have reflect cast 
    on them so that the non-targetable spell can be reflected off a monster and land 
    on a learner. Some monsters may only use their !Blue spell when under the 
    influence of Confuse.
- Level n Spell: >
    The learner must have a level which is a multiple of n and be affected by the spell. 
    In the case of Level 5 Death, the learner must have a level which is a multiple of 5, 
    AND they must die to learn the spell. Be careful not to have all party members at the 
    same level when attempting to learn this skill.
