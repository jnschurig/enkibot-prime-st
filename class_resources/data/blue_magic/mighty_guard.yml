Mighty Guard:
  Alternate Name: Guardian
  MP Cost: 72
  Learned From:
  - Ironclad:
    - "!Control"
  - Stingray:
    - "!Control"
    - "Confuse"
  - Shinryu:
    - "!Control"
  - Azulmagia:
    - "Reflect"
  Earliest Acquisition:
    Stingray: Ocean Above Sunken Walse Tower (World 3)
  Best Source:
  - Stingray: Ocean Above Sunken Walse Tower (World 3)
  - Azulmagia: Interdimensional Rift (See Note)
  Description: >
    Applies Protect, Shell, and Float to entire party. Multi-target.
  Note:
    For learning from Azulmagia, any source of Reflect will do the trick. 
    Azulmagia can cast Mighty Guard on their third turn and again on every 
    sixth turn thereafter. 
    In the Pixel Remaster version of the game, Confuse will make Stingray 
    incorrectly cast White Wind on the enemy team, rather than the player 
    team. In other versions this works correctly.
